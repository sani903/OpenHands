1. Could you provide more specific details about the ""separability matrix"" in this context? What exactly is a separability matrix, and in what specific part of the modeling library is this computation happening?

2. Can you give me an example of a nested compound model where the separability computation is incorrect? This would help me understand the specific scenario where the issue occurs.

3. Are there any specific error messages or unexpected behaviors you've observed when dealing with nested compound models?

These questions will help me get a clearer picture of the problem and guide my investigation into the repository.","1. The separability matrix is used to determine if the outputs and inputs of a model are independent or separable. It's part of the modeling library, specifically in the `separable` module of Astropy.

2. Sure, when using a nested compound model like `m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm` where `cm` is `m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)`, the separability matrix output is unexpected. The matrix reflects that the inputs and outputs are no longer separable, which seems incorrect given the simplicity of the linear models.

3. There aren't any error messages, but the incorrect behavior is that the separability matrix for nested compound models suggests the inputs and outputs are not separable when they should be.","The issue involves the incorrect computation of the separability matrix for nested compound models in a modeling library. While the separability matrix is computed correctly for simple and non-nested compound models, the expected separability is not maintained when models are nested, leading to unexpected results. This discrepancy suggests a potential bug or oversight in handling nested structures within the separability computation logic."

2. An example of the formatting issue is when using `formats={""a"": lambda x: f""{x:.2e}""}` to write a table column ""a"" with scientific notation in HTML. The output ignores this formatting and shows full decimal places instead.

3. Yes, specifically number formatting is failing to be rendered in the HTML output.

3. Can you share a minimal code example that demonstrates this inconsistency? This would help me understand the exact nature of the problem.

These questions will help me gather the necessary context to investigate and resolve the issue effectively.","1. The `SlicedLowLevelWCS` class is located in the file `astropy/wcs/wcsapi/wrappers/sliced_wcs.py`.

2. The inconsistency arises when performing a `world_to_pixel` operation. For a full (unsliced) 3D WCS, the operation returns the expected pixel coordinates. However, performing the same operation on a sliced 2D WCS (where I've sliced one wavelength layer) returns an incorrect result, particularly for the first dimension.

3. I've actually included a complete self-contained minimal code example in the issue description itself. It demonstrates how the 3D WCS gives the expected result while the sliced 2D WCS returns an incorrect result.

```python
qs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])

3. The descending sort order is unexpected as it comes from the default sort order in the `OneModel` class (`Meta: ordering = (""-id"",)`).

For instance, if I have the Django app set to UTC and I use `TruncDate()` with the ""America/New_York"" timezone, the result is incorrect because it ignores the provided timezone info.

3. The workaround involves using `TruncDay` instead and then manually converting the DateTime objects returned outside of the database context.

These questions will help me understand the problem more precisely and guide my investigation and solution. Could you please provide more insights?","1. The issue occurs with Django's runserver starting from version 1.10. It returns response bodies for HTTP HEAD requests, which should not happen. When running a HEAD request, you should receive only the headers, but instead, the full HTML content is returned. This error can cause ""Broken pipe"" messages because compliant user agents terminate the connection after they receive only headers.

2. For HTTP HEAD requests, the specification states that the response should include headers identical to those that would be sent if the request were a GET, but no message body should be returned. Thus, the body should be completely stripped.

3. I suspect the issue might be related to the runserver's handling within `django/core/servers/basehttp.py`, where the response is constructed, but not specifically stripped for HEAD requests after the change from #26052. It might also involve middleware but that specific part does not handle the stripping as expected.","There is an issue with Django's development server (`runserver`) where it incorrectly includes response bodies in HTTP HEAD requests, which is not compliant with the HTTP/1.1 specification.

   - The issue occurs in a Django model setup involving a many-to-many relationship (`Test` to `TestTag`) with a `TestTag` model that has a foreign key to `TestTagMaster`.
   - I provided a code snippet in the description that demonstrates the `FieldError` when trying to serialize an object.
   - I'm using Django's built-in serialization library.

2. Regarding the custom manager using `select_related`:

   - The custom manager is designed to enhance query performance by using `select_related(""master"")` when retrieving `TestTag` objects, which optimizes joins on the foreign key to `TestTagMaster`.
   - The manager modifies the default queryset to always follow the `master` relationship by default in its `get_queryset` method. 

I hope this helps clarify the issue!","There is an issue with serializing a many-to-many relationship in Django when using a custom manager that employs `select_related`. The problem arises because the serialization process encounters a `FieldError`, indicating that a field cannot be both deferred and traversed with `select_related` simultaneously.

3. Can you clarify what you mean by ""data type not being conserved""? Are you referring to the dtype of the underlying data, or something else?

These questions will help me understand the exact requirements and scope of the changes needed to fix the issue.","1. The `xr.where()` function currently takes a DataArray with attributes and produces a new DataArray without those attributes. For example:

```python
import numpy as np
import xarray as xr

data = xr.DataArray(np.ones([10,10], dtype=np.int8))
data.attrs[""attr_1""] = ""test1""
data.attrs[""attr_2""] = ""test2""

data2 = xr.where(data == 1, 5, 0)
```
In this example, `data2` loses the attributes ""attr_1"" and ""attr_2"" present in `data`.

2. All attributes should be maintained, or there should be an option to choose which attributes to preserve.

3. By ""data type not being conserved,"" I refer to the dtype of the resulting DataArray. In the example, the original `data` has dtype `np.int8`, but the resulting `data2` has dtype `np.int64`.","The issue involves the `xr.where` function in the xarray library, which is not preserving the attributes of a DataArray when applied. Users expect the attributes to be retained in the resulting DataArray, but they are currently being lost. Additionally, there is a concern about the data type not being conserved, as the output DataArray has a different data type than expected. The problem highlights a need for a mechanism to maintain attributes, possibly through additional parameters or options within the function."

The error occurs because pytest 5.2.3 tries to import any `__init__.py` file under the current directory, and if there's a package that's not compatible with the running platform, like a package only for Windows on a Linux system, it will trigger import errors, such as an `AssertionError`.

2. Yes, the minimal example is in my initial report. It involves creating a directory `foobar`, adding an `__init__.py` file with `assert False`, setting up a `tox.ini`, and then running tox to see the behavior change between pytest 5.2.2 and 5.2.3.

3. The problem arises when there are `__init__.py` files that shouldn't be imported automatically by pytest, particularly if the imports can cause environment-specific issues or if they interfere with setups like Django, where initial imports must be controlled.","A regression issue has been identified in pytest version 5.2.3, where it attempts to import `__init__.py` files from the current directory, causing errors during test collection.

sympy__sympy-24562,0.893507587951252,0.10649241204874804,"I'll help you solve this issue systematically. Let me start by asking some clarifying questions to understand the problem better.

1. Could you provide a specific example of the discrepancy in rational number calculation between string and numerical inputs in SymPy when using Python 3.11? 

2. Can you confirm which specific SymPy function or method is exhibiting this behavior? Is it related to rational number conversion, creation, or a specific mathematical operation?

3. Do you have a minimal reproducible code snippet that demonstrates this issue?

These questions will help me understand the precise nature of the problem and guide my investigation into the SymPy library's implementation.","1. When using `Rational('0.5', '100')`, the output is `1/100100`, which is incorrect. But `Rational(0.5, 100)` gives `1/200`, which is the correct result.

2. The SymPy `Rational` function is exhibiting this behavior during rational number creation when using string inputs.

3. Yes, the minimal reproducible code is:
   ```python
   from sympy import Rational
   print(Rational('0.5', '100'))
   print(Rational(0.5, 100))
   ```","There is a discrepancy in the calculation of rational numbers using the SymPy library in Python 3.11. Specifically, when using string inputs, the result differs from using numerical inputs, leading to an incorrect rational value. This issue did not occur in an earlier version of the library."
