2. Sure, when using a nested compound model like `m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm` where `cm` is `m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)`, the separability matrix output is unexpected. The matrix reflects that the inputs and outputs are no longer separable, which seems incorrect given the simplicity of the linear models.

2. The inconsistency arises when performing a `world_to_pixel` operation. For a full (unsliced) 3D WCS, the operation returns the expected pixel coordinates. However, performing the same operation on a sliced 2D WCS (where I've sliced one wavelength layer) returns an incorrect result, particularly for the first dimension.

3. I've actually included a complete self-contained minimal code example in the issue description itself. It demonstrates how the 3D WCS gives the expected result while the sliced 2D WCS returns an incorrect result. Let me know if you need me to repeat that snippet here. Certainly!

2. An example is the issue raised in #13319, where users faced problems with satellite observations. Generally, users attempting to convert satellite positions expressed in ITRS directly to an observed frame without considering the topocentric position experience these inaccuracies.

3. By ""staying within the ITRS framework,"" I mean transforming coordinates between ITRS and observed frames like AltAz and HADec while assuming that the ITRS positions on the Earth's surface remain constant over time, except for plate tectonics or other significant movements.

For example, if a form alters its validation error messages based on user input or context, those alterations will incorrectly appear on all instances, leading to confusion.

2. This is a general problem across all form fields, as the `__deepcopy__` method doesn't specifically handle error messages for any particular field types, resulting in shared state across different form instances.

3. Dynamic modifications typically occur when forms adjust their error messages based on user-specific logic or context.

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db.models import OuterRef, Subquery
from django.test import TestCase
from django.utils.functional import SimpleLazyObject
from ..models import A, B, C

class BugTestCase(TestCase):
    def test_bug(self):
        owner_user = (
            B.objects.filter(a=OuterRef(""pk""))
            .annotate(owner_user=Subquery(C.objects.values(""owner"")))
            .values(""owner_user"")
        )
        user = SimpleLazyObject(lambda: User.objects.create_user(""testuser""))
        A.objects.annotate(owner_user=Subquery(owner_user)).filter(
            owner_user=user
        )
```

This snippet uses `SimpleLazyObject` with a nested subquery for filtering, leading to the TypeError. 1. The TypeError message is: `TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'SimpleLazyObject'`. This error occurs because Django's lookup logic tries to convert the SimpleLazyObject to an integer during query filtering.

2. Models A, B, and C are custom models defined in the project. Model A is a standalone model, B has a ForeignKey to A, and C has a ForeignKey to User.

django__django-12708,"1. The ValueError is triggered in django/db/backends/base/schema.py at line 378, specifically in the `_delete_composed_index()` method. It happens when trying to delete an `index_together` constraint that overlaps with a `unique_together` constraint, and both constraints involve the same fields. An example scenario would be a model with two fields where both are included in `unique_together` and `index_together`. When attempting to delete `index_together`, the error occurs because Django finds two constraints: one for `_uniq` and one for `_idx`.

2. Yes, the issue occurs in Django version 1.11.10.

3. The newer feature mentioned is related to using the `Meta` class for declaring indexes with the `indexes` option, which was introduced in Django 1.11.

django__django-12754,"1. Sure, here's an example scenario: Initially, you have a base model `Readable` with a field `title`. You then create a subclass `Book` and move the `title` field from `Readable` to `Book` in one migration step. This leads to a `FieldError` when running `migrate`, due to a clash of the `title` field on `Book` from the base class `Readable` that still has the field at the start of the migration.

2. The problem generally occurs with multi-table inheritance when the migration is generated in the incorrect order (i.e., creating the subclass before removing the field from the base model). Any model with fields that are transferred this way can encounter the issue, not restricted to any specific field types.

3. Yes, the issue can be reproduced with the following setup:

   - Start with:

2. The table locks mentioned refer to database-level table locks, specifically in relation to MySQL's limitations with locking tables used multiple times in a query without aliases.

3. Yes, in Django 3.0, the SQL was DELETE FROM `testapp_alphabet`, but in Django 3.1, it changed to DELETE FROM `testapp_alphabet` WHERE `testapp_alphabet`.`id` IN (SELECT `testapp_alphabet`.`id` FROM `testapp_alphabet`), which is problematic. 1. Yes, the performance issue is specifically related to the `delete()` method in Django's ORM, not a custom implementation.

2. Yes, the issue occurs even with the MySQL compiler's implementation. The generated SQL still includes the subquery causing the regression.

3. I don't have a minimal code example, but it involves calling `Model.objects.all().delete()` on a table with a large number of rows (100k) and using the Django 3.1 version where the new SQL pattern is generated.",[],0,0
django__django-13033,"1. The issue occurs in the `OneModel` class where there's a self-referencing foreign key. Here's the specific part of the model:

```python
class OneModel(models.Model):

    id = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)
    root = models.ForeignKey(""OneModel"", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)

2. An example of the unexpected behavior in query ordering is when using the following queryset:

```python
qs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])
qs = qs.order_by(""record__root_id"")
print(qs.query)

This results in:

```

3. The descending sort order is unexpected as it comes from the default sort order in the `OneModel` class (`Meta: ordering = (""-id"",)`). The issue is that the `order_by()` clause specifying `record__root_id` doesn't override this default ordering, leading to an extra and unnecessary `DESC` in the SQL query.",[],0,True

django__django-13343,"1. The current implementation incorrectly evaluates the callable for the storage parameter by actually executing the callable during the deconstruction process.

2. Yes, by ""maintaining a reference to the callable,"" I mean that during deconstruction, instead of storing the result of the callable evaluation, the deconstruction process should store a reference to the callable itself, just like how it already handles a callable `upload_to` parameter.

3. One scenario that highlights this issue is when the storage callable is designed to return different storage configurations based on the current environment settings.

2. The specific migration loader method that needs to be modified is `load_disk` in the `MigrationLoader` class located in `django/db/migrations/loader.py`.

3. The current behavior that is problematic is that the migration loader skips searching for migrations in a module if the module does not have a `__file__` attribute, assuming it's a namespace package. This prevents Django from finding existing migrations in frozen environments. I would appreciate if you create a test script to verify the changes.

2. Yes, this is happening with a standard Django model relationship, specifically a many-to-one relationship using a standard `ForeignKey`.

3. The foreign key violation occurs at the commit of the transaction.

2. Yes, I'm expecting the primary key to be returned as an instance of `MyIntWrapper` instead of a plain integer upon creation. The issue is that, after inserting a new record with `create` or `bulk_create`, the ID is set as a plain integer instead of being wrapped with `MyIntWrapper`.

3. Yes, the issue occurs in both regular creation and `bulk_create` scenarios. In both cases, I expect the conversion to `MyIntWrapper` to occur for the primary key value upon insertion into the database. 1. Yes, `MyIntWrapper` is a custom wrapper class. Here's a minimal example:

```python
class MyIntWrapper(int):

The models have a foreign key relationship between `Book` and `Author`. The issue doesn't seem specific to any database backend, as I've not noticed this being more prominent in PostgreSQL or SQLite.

2. By ""secondary database,"" I mean using multiple database configurations in Django settings. I am not using a database router for this.

3. Yes, the update operation affects the `OtherBase` model instead of the intended `Child` instances. The behavior is that `OtherBase` fields are being updated instead of the fields in the `Child` instances, due to the query using primary keys from the `Base` class to update `OtherBase`, which is incorrect. 1. The model definitions are as follows:

2. When the UUIDField does not receive its default value, it ends up being set to `null`, which causes an error when the object is saved. 1. The `Thing` model uses a UUIDField defined as follows:
   - `id = models.UUIDField(default=uuid.uuid4, editable=False, unique=True)`
   - It's not a primary key; the primary key is a BigAutoField named `pkid`.
   - The field is set to be unique with a default value provided by `uuid.uuid4`.

2. In the admin interface:
   - Yes, there's a custom `ModelAdmin` for `Thing`. It's set up with an `inline` for `SubThing`.
   - The inline is defined using `admin.StackedInline` and is linked to the `SubThing` model.

matplotlib__matplotlib-21568,"1. The specific versions I'm referring to are matplotlib 3.3.4 as the ""older version"" and 3.4.3 as the ""newer version"". The label spacing issue makes the datetime axis unclear in version 3.4.3 when `usetex=True`. You can see the differences in the outcome images I included. In version 3.3.4, the spacing looks clearer and is not rendered with TeX, while in 3.4.3, the dates are rendered with TeX but the spacing is incorrect.

2. Yes, I am referring to using LaTeX-style text rendering for the datetime labels when mentioning ""LaTeX formatting"".

3. I've already provided a minimal code example in my initial report that highlights the issue. You can use the following code for testing without Pandas:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

```

In version 3.3.4, the label spacing is clear but not rendered with TeX, while in 3.4.3, they are rendered with TeX where the spacing has issues. In version 3.4.3, the spacing looks unclear and awkward due to incorrect protection of spaces when rendering with LaTeX, making it hard to read the datetime labels. They are not overlapping but don't have the clear and expected distribution seen in version 3.3.4.

2. By ""edges between color segments,"" I mean the black lines that should separate each color band in the colorbar. ""Boundary lines at the ends of the colorbar"" refer to these same black lines that should also appear at the very start and end of the colorbar when it's extended beyond the typical range.

3. My primary interest is in preserving the gid for AnnotationBbox containing images, but it could be beneficial for gid preservation in general within Matplotlib. I've already included a code snippet in the original issue report. It shows the process of creating an AnnotationBbox, setting the gid using `ab.set_gid('My_label')`, and saving the figure as an SVG using `fig.savefig(""example.svg"", format=""svg"")`. Additionally, the print statement `print(f""GID = {ab.get_gid()}"")` is used to confirm the gid. You can refer back to the original issue details for the full example. I'm sorry for any confusion.

2. The issue occurs when the registered name of the colormap is different from its internal name. It's problematic especially if you import a colormap from another module, register it with a different name, and expect to use the newly assigned name.

3. The discrepancy arises because the registered name and the internal name of the colormap object can be different.

3. The problem specifically affects unicode strings, where IndexVariable's with dtype='<U*' are cast to object during a deep copy.",[],0,0
pydata__xarray-3151,"1. The error is raised by the `xr.combine_by_coords` function in xarray when trying to combine datasets with non-monotonic coordinate dimensions.

2. Sure, here's the code that triggers the error:

    ```python
    import xarray as xr
    import numpy as np

    # yCoord = ['a', 'b', 'c']  # works without error
    yCoord = ['a', 'c', 'b']  # raises ValueError on combine

3. Yes, by ""non-monotonic coordinate dimensions,"" I mean that the coordinate values are not in a strictly increasing or decreasing order. In this case, the `y` coordinate has values `['a', 'c', 'b']`, which are not ordered.",[],0,0
pydata__xarray-3677,"1. The exact objects being merged are a `Dataset` and a `DataArray`. The error encountered is an `AttributeError` that says a 'DataArray' object has no attribute 'items'.

2. It's the `.merge()` method of the `Dataset` object that is failing.

3. Yes, using the top-level `merge()` function with `[ds, da]` works successfully, while using `ds.merge(da)` fails with the mentioned error.",[],0,0
pydata__xarray-4629,"1. Certainly! Here's an example of how the current `merge` function behaves with `combine_attrs='override'`:

```python
import xarray as xr
xds1 = xr.Dataset(attrs={'a':'b'})
xds2 = xr.Dataset(attrs={'a':'c'})
xds3 = xr.merge([xds1, xds2], combine_attrs='override')
xds3.attrs['a'] = 'd'
print(xds1.attrs['a'])  # This unexpectedly prints 'd' instead of 'b'
```

After the merge, modifying the `attrs` of `xds3` also modifies `xds1`, which is unexpected.

2. Yes, the `merge` function is located in the `xarray/core/merge.py` file.

3. Exactly, when I say ""references"" the attributes, it means that the attributes from the first dataset are being shared by reference rather than being deeply copied. This is why changes to the merged dataset's attributes affect the original dataset.",['xarray/core/merge.py'],1,True
pydata__xarray-4966,"1. Sure! netCDF3 only knows signed bytes, but there's a convention to add an attribute `_Unsigned=True` to handle unsigned bytes. This is already managed in `xarray`. On the other hand, OPeNDAP knows only unsigned bytes, and there's a hack involving adding an attribute `_Unsigned=False` to handle signed bytes. This hack is not currently handled by `xarray`.

2. Yes, here's an example using a dataset:

```python
import xarray as xr

# Using netcdf4 engine
ds_netcdf4 = xr.open_dataset(""https://observations.ipsl.fr/thredds/dodsC/EUREC4A/PRODUCTS/testdata/netcdf_testfiles/test_NC_BYTE_neg.nc"", engine=""netcdf4"")

3. The main requirement is to handle `_Unsigned=False` symmetrically in `xarray`, similar to how `_Unsigned=True` is handled, to ensure consistent interpretation of signed byte data from OPeNDAP via pydap.",[],0,True
pydata__xarray-6461,"1. Sure! The minimal code example is as follows:

   ```python
   import xarray as xr

   xr.where(xr.DataArray([1, 2, 3]) > 0, 1, 0, keep_attrs=True)
   ```

   This results in the `IndexError: list index out of range` when `keep_attrs=True` is used.

2. Yes, this issue occurs in xarray version 2022.3.0.

3. Yes, by ""scalar as the second argument"", I mean using a scalar value as the `other` parameter in the `xr.where()` function. In this example, `1` is the `other` parameter.",[],0,0
pydata__xarray-6599,"1. Yes, the `polyval` function is used in the example I provided as follows:

2. The specific incorrect behavior is that the results from the `polyval` function are different between `xarray=2022.3.0` and the latest unreleased version (`main`, `commit 6bb2b855498b5c68d7cca8cceb710365d58e604`). The results are correct in `xarray=2022.3.0`, but in the latest unreleased version, the results are wrong, with unexpected large values.

```

2. The behavior changed starting from version `2022.06.0`.

3. By ""coordinate attributes being overwritten by variable attributes,"" I mean that the original attributes associated with coordinates are being replaced with the attributes from the variable after using `xr.where(..., keep_attrs=True)`. This results in the loss of coordinate-specific attributes.",[],0,0
pydata__xarray-7233,"1. I've already provided a minimal complete verifiable example in the issue description, demonstrating the unexpected behavior of `ds.Coarsen.construct` where non-dimensional coordinates such as `day` are converted into variables.

2. By ""non-dimensional coordinates,"" I mean coordinates that are present in the dataset but are not used as dimensions. In this example, 'day' is a coordinate of the dataset that is not a primary indexing dimension like 'time'.

pylint-dev__pylint-4970,"1. Yes, this is referring to Pylint.

2. When setting `min-similarity-lines` to `0` in the rcfile, it doesn't disable the duplicate code check, but instead treats every line of code as a duplicate, resulting in many errors.

3. Yes, by ""flags every line as problematic,"" I mean it raises errors related to duplicate code for each line, which is not the expected behavior.",[],0,0
pylint-dev__pylint-6386,"1. The issue occurs specifically in the Pylint CLI tool.

2. The current behavior is that using the short option `-v` for verbose requires an argument, while the long option `--verbose` does not require one. For example, running `pylint mytest.py -v` gives an error, whereas `pylint mytest.py --verbose` works without issues. The expected behavior is that `-v` should work the same as `--verbose` and not expect an argument.

3. Yes, when using the short option `-v`, I get the error message: `pylint: error: argument --verbose/-v: expected one argument`.",[],0,0
pylint-dev__pylint-4661,"1. Pylint should use XDG_CACHE_HOME for what I'm assuming are non-crucial, cache-like data files. Though there's a consideration if it should be XDG_DATA_HOME if backups are a concern.

2. Right now, the `.pylint.d` directory in my home folder stores these data files that need to be moved to an XDG-compliant location.

3. Yes, backward compatibility is important. If XDG variables are not set, it should fall back to the current behavior of using the home directory storage.",[],0,0
pylint-dev__pylint-6903,"1. The `--jobs=0` option is used to let Pylint automatically determine the number of CPUs available to decide how many processes to run in parallel. When set to zero, the expectation is that Pylint will calculate a suitable number of worker processes based on available system resources.

2. Yes, I am referring to the function `pylint.run._query_cpu()` in the Pylint codebase. This function reads certain system files to calculate the number of CPUs available for use.

3. Yes, in the Kubernetes environment where this issue occurs, specific characteristics include configurations of the cgroup files, such as `cpu.cfs_quota_us`, `cpu.cfs_period_us`, and `cpu.shares`. For instance, the quota is `-1`, period is `100000`, and shares are `2`. These result in the calculation of available CPUs as zero because of the division and casting to `int`.",[],0,True
pylint-dev__pylint-7080,"1. The issue relates to the Pylint tool where using the `--recursive=y` option seems to ignore the `ignore-paths` configuration set in the `pyproject.toml` file. This is specifically about Pylint's file scanning during linting.

2. The paths that should be ignored are those matching `^src/gen/.*$`. The unintended files being processed are those in the `src/gen` directory, as shown in the output where multiple files from that path are linted despite being listed in `ignore-paths`.

In this case, I expect `TestDings` to have both `foo` and `bar` markers, but due to MRO, only one is applied unless a metaclass is used.

2. Yes, I want to combine markers from multiple base classes rather than having them overridden by the MRO, merging them into one set of markers.

3. The fix could potentially be a breaking change, so it should be considered for a major release like 7.0. There is also a backward compatibility concern with existing tests that rely on the current behavior. The change should ideally not introduce significant performance overhead.",[],0,0
pytest-dev__pytest-10081,"1. When I run `pytest --pdb`, the `tearDown()` method of the `unittest.TestCase` class, which is decorated with `unittest.skip` at the class level, gets executed. This happens even though the class should be skipped, as indicated by the decorator. Normally, without `--pdb`, the test is correctly identified as skipped.

2. This behavior only occurs when running pytest with the `--pdb` option. Without `--pdb`, the test class is correctly skipped.

3. Here's a minimal code example to reproduce the issue:

Specifically, the `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` advertises a mode of `rb+`, but its `write()` method raises an exception when passed `bytes`. An error message similar to `TypeError: write() argument must be str, not bytes` is shown.

2. The current mode of the underlying stream is `rb+`, which indicates binary mode. It should not include `b`, so the correct mode would handle strings, such as `r+`.

The inconsistency occurs when using `LogisticRegressionCV(multi_class='multinomial')`, which expects the logistic regression predictions to follow the multinomial approach using the softmax function.

2. The inconsistency is highlighted in scenarios where the scoring function relies on probability predictions, like `neg_log_loss`. The multinomial approach should use softmax, but because the instance defaults to one-vs-rest, it uses a single logistic function, leading to different probability scores.

3. In the current implementation, the multi-class strategy is not being inherited when the `LogisticRegression` instance is created within the scoring path at line 922 in `logistic.py`.

sphinx-doc__sphinx-11510,"1. The custom Sphinx extension we're using is called `my-extension`. It performs a search and replace operation to replace occurrences of the string `&REPLACE_ME;` with `REPLACED` in our documentation. This extension is crucial for the Yocto documentation to ensure certain placeholders are correctly replaced with their intended values throughout the built documentation.

2. The issue is that in the final HTML output, the placeholder `&REPLACE_ME;` is sometimes not being replaced as expected. Specifically, this happens with files that are included using the `.. include::` directive. The search and replace operation is applied successfully to directly processed files, but included files don't reflect these changes in the final HTML output. For example, in a file called `something-to-include.rst`, the transformation does not occur when it's included in another document.

3. I have not tested this behavior in other Sphinx versions, so I can't confirm if it's specific to version 5.0.2. 1. Yes, `my-extension` is a custom extension not part of the Sphinx core repository. The code for this extension essentially involves connecting to the `source-read` event and conducting a search and replace operation within the processed source content. Here's a simplified version of how the extension is set up:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from sphinx.application import Sphinx

def subst_vars_replace(app: Sphinx, docname, source):
    result = source[0]
    result = result.replace(""&REPLACE_ME;"", ""REPLACED"")
    source[0] = result

def setup(app: Sphinx):
    app.connect('source-read', subst_vars_replace)
    return dict(
        version='1.0',
        parallel_read_safe=True,
        parallel_write_safe=True
    )
```

2. An example RST file illustrating the issue is as follows:

`index.rst`:
```reStructuredText
This is a test
==============

.. include:: something-to-include.rst

&REPLACE_ME;
```

`something-to-include.rst`:
```reStructuredText

=======

&REPLACE_ME;
```

3. Yes, we are using this custom Sphinx extension to perform the replacement. The replacement operation is integrated into the documentation build process through the `source-read` event. The way it's supposed to work is that the `source-read` event is triggered for every document, and the specified string replacements are applied wherever applicable.

The translations I'm trying to modify are specifically for UI text like figure and code block captions. An example of translation not being overridden is changing ""Fig. %s"" to ""Foobar %s"" and ""Listing %s"" to ""Whatever %s"". Despite adding custom entries, the default Danish translations are still used.

2. The custom translation file is a `.po` file located in `locale/da/LC_MESSAGES/sphinx.po`, and a corresponding `.mo` file is generated.

3. To try and override the translations, I've done the following:

   - Added the `.po` file to the directory `locale/da/LC_MESSAGES/`.
   - The `conf.py` file has the setting `language = 'da'`.
   - Set `gettext_auto_build = True` to ensure the `.mo` file is created.

3. One example is `cdf(Arcsin(""x"", 0, 3))(1)`, which returns `Integral(1/sqrt(-_x**2 + 3*_x), (_x, -oo, 1))/pi` and doesn't converge. This showcases the limitation where the integration fails to provide a proper result.",[],0,0

2. The problem with the ""complex exponential term"" is with `exp_polar(-I*pi)` appearing in the expansion of `polylog(1, z)`. It shows up in expressions like `-log(z*exp_polar(-I*pi) + 1)`, where it seems unnecessary and doesn't contribute to the function correctly, particularly in the context of branch cuts and definition alignment.

3. The derivative of `polylog(1, z) + log(1 - z)` should be zero, as SymPy correctly computes. However, `expand_func(polylog(1, z))` results in `exp_polar(-I*pi)/(z*exp_polar(-I*pi) + 1) + 1/(-z + 1)`, which does not simplify to zero.

   The problematic polynomial comes from calling `clear_denoms()` on a complex zero polynomial that ends up not behaving like a proper zero polynomial.

3. The issue manifests inconsistently. The `Poly.is_zero()` method returns `False` while `bad_poly.as_expr()` evaluates to `0`. Other polynomial methods like `terms_gcd()` throw an `IndexError` due to this inconsistency.",[],0,0
sympy__sympy-20590,"1. In version 1.6.2, `Symbol` instances did not have a `__dict__` attribute, meaning if you tried to access it, you'd get an `AttributeError`. In 1.7, the `__dict__` attribute now exists and returns an empty dictionary.

2. This change seems to be an unintended change in the class's structure due to inheritance changes, rather than a direct functional issue. The issue primarily relates to implementation details, specifically the use of `__slots__` for memory optimization and immutability.",[],0,0
sympy__sympy-20438,"1. Sure, an example of the incorrect result is when you have `ProductSet(a, a)` and `FiniteSet((1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2))`. In this case, `b.is_subset(c)` does not evaluate correctly.

2. The `is_subset` method you should be looking at is likely within the `sympy/sets/handlers/issubset.py` file.

3. The issue arises during simplification operations, specifically when computing equality with simplification, such as `Eq(b, c).simplify()`, which results in an error indicating `AttributeError: 'Complement' object has no attribute 'equals'`.",['sympy/sets/handlers/issubset.py'],1,0
sympy__sympy-20801,"1. The inconsistent comparison occurs when using `S(0.0)` and `S.false`. Specifically, `S(0.0) == S.false` returns `True`, while `S.false == S(0.0)` returns `False`.

2. This issue is occurring within the SymPy library, particularly related to numbers and potentially comparison operations.

3. Here's a code snippet demonstrating the unexpected comparison results:

sympy__sympy-20916,"1. An example is `œâ=[sp.Symbol(f'œâ{i}') for i in range(4)]`. When pretty printed using `sp.pprint(œâ)`, it results in `[œâ0, œâ1, œâ2, œâ3]`, which is not the expected subscript format.

2. I believe the issue is happening in `sympy/printing/conventions.py`, as there seems to be a regular expression that's not correctly handling Unicode letters for subscripts.

3. By ""inconsistent representation,"" I mean the subscripts are not being rendered as actual subscripts for Greek letters, while Latin letters seem to work fine.",['sympy/printing/conventions.py'],1,0

   expr.subs({1: 1.0})
   ```

2. The specific hyperbolic functions causing the error are `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh`. The piecewise arguments look like `Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True))`.

3. The error occurs with real symbols for `x` and `y`, while `z` doesn't need to be real.",[],0,0
sympy__sympy-21612,"1. The problematic LaTeX expression is `""\frac{\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\frac{1}{c^2}}""`, which is parsed incorrectly.

2. It's related to the printing part of the SymPy library rather than parsing.

sympy__sympy-21596,"1. Sure! A specific example is when you have a set `S1` defined as `imageset(Lambda(n, n + (n - 1)*(n + 1)*I), S.Integers)`. In this case, checking if `2` is in `S1.intersect(Reals)` incorrectly returns `True`, but it should return `False`.

2. I don't have that information.

3. Yes, in this context, even if a real number appears to satisfy the conditions of both sets, it should not be considered part of the intersection if it doesn't truly belong in the set when defined by the given expression.",[],0,0
sympy__sympy-21847,"1. The current incorrect behavior occurs when you use the `itermonomials` function with both `max_degrees` and `min_degrees` set to 3 for symbolic variables `x1, x2, x3`. It should generate monomials with a total degree of 3, like `x1*x2**2` or `x2*x3**2`, but instead only returns `[x3**3, x2**3, x1**3]`.

2. The ""min_degrees"" and ""maximum and minimum degree constraint"" refer to the total degree of the monomials, not the degree of individual variables. It should generate monomials where the total degree is between the specified `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`.

a = sp.Symbol('0')
Commutator(Bd(a)**2, B(a))
```
The issue shows up with the output:

```latex
\displaystyle - \left[b_{0},b^\dagger_{0}^{2}\right]
```

2. The issue occurs within the `sympy/physics/secondquant.py` file from what I understand.

3. The output is incorrect because it's rendering `b^\dagger_{0}^{2}` when it should be rendering `{b^\dagger_{0}}^{2}` with proper brackets to correctly format the superscript with the ""dagger"" involved.",['sympy/physics/secondquant.py'],1,0
sympy__sympy-22080,"1. Yes, here is a minimal code example demonstrating the issue:

expr = -Mod(x, y)
g = lambdify([x, y], expr, modules=[])
print(g(3, 7))  # Expected output: -3, Actual output: 4
```

2. I don't have the exact file, but the `lambdify` function is part of the SymPy utilities module, so it should be in a file related to utilities.

3. The transformation observed is that when using `lambdify` with an empty `modules` list, the expression `-Mod(x, y)` is incorrectly transformed to `-x % y` instead of the expected Python expression equivalent to `-Mod(x, y)`, resulting in incorrect behavior.",[],0,0
sympy__sympy-22456,"1. Currently, the `codegen.ast` `String` class does not support the argument invariance where `expr.func(*expr.args) == expr`. This means that when you reconstruct an object using its function and arguments, it should equal the original object. Instead, it currently uses `expr.func(**expr.kwargs()) == expr`, but the expected behavior for a `Basic` subclass is the former.

2. The ""different form of invariance"" refers to the fact that instead of reconstructing using `*expr.args`, it's using `**expr.kwargs()`. The issue is that reconstruction should be consistent with the typical form used by `Basic` subclasses, which is using positional arguments.

3. For SymPy's `Basic` class, argument invariance means that when you take a function (`func`) and its arguments (`args`), and you recreate the object using these, it should be identical to the original object. It's about ensuring consistency in object reconstruction using the function and its positional arguments.",[],0,0

The output currently is:
```python

2. The HNF computation is implemented in the `sympy/polys/matrices/normalforms.py` file.

3. The issue arises when trying to achieve a row-style Hermite Normal Form by performing operations like `np.flip` and `transpose` on the matrix. Specifically, `np.flip(hermite_normal_form(Matrix(np.flip(np.array([[5, 8, 12], [0, 0, 1]]))).T).T)` unexpectedly gives a rank-deficient result `[[5, 8, 0]]` instead of `[[5, 8, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`.",['sympy/polys/matrices/normalforms.py'],1,0

   ```python
   >>> Contains(x, Reals).as_set()

   This is incorrect because `Contains` should not be returned as it is not a set.

2. The expected behavior of `Contains.as_set` is to return the set itself if the condition is true, or `EmptySet` if false. Essentially, `Contains(x, set).as_set()` should return `set`.

sympy__sympy-24066,"1. The issue is with the `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` function in the SymPy library. This function is not properly detecting that the exponent is dimensionless.

2. The problem occurs when using an expression like `units.second / (units.ohm * units.farad)` inside the `exp()` function. For example, `buggy_expr = 100 + exp(expr)` triggers the error.

   The expected result should be: `4*GammaMatrix(rho)*GammaMatrix(sigma)`.

sympy__sympy-24539,"1. The current issue with `PolyElement.as_expr()` is that if you provide the right number of symbols as arguments, it ignores them and uses the predefined `self.ring.symbols`. For example, in the code snippet I provided, when I call `f.as_expr(U, V, W)`, it should use `U, V, W` as symbols, but it instead uses `x, y, z`.

2. Yes, the issue is about being able to specify custom symbols to be used in the expression conversion, instead of always using the default ones in the polynomial ring.

3. By ""defaults to using predefined symbols,"" I mean that it uses `self.ring.symbols` regardless of whether I provide custom symbols during the method call. These predefined symbols are the ones associated with the ring when it is created.",[],0,True
sympy__sympy-24443,"1. The `_check_homomorphism` function is related to the issue with the internal `_image()` function. This is located in the file `sympy/combinatorics/homomorphisms.py`.

2. The issue arises when `r[i]` is an inverted generator in a `PermutationGroup`. The test `in gens` fails in such cases, meaning it's unable to recognize or handle inverted generators correctly.

3. The error message provided is: 
   ```
   ValueError: The given images do not define a homomorphism

   This occurs when attempting to create a homomorphism with `D3` dihedral group and its generators. 1. A concrete example involves using inverted generators like `D3.generators`. When the internal `_image()` tries to check if a particular `r[i]` (which could be an inverted generator) is within `gens`, it doesn't correctly identify it.

2. The exact input triggering the `ValueError` is trying to create a homomorphism with:
   ```python
   D3 = DihedralGroup(3)
   T = homomorphism(D3, D3, D3.generators, D3.generators)

2. The `parse_expr` function is located in the file `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`.

3. ""Evaluated to a boolean value"" means that instead of returning the expression `1 < 2` as is, it is being converted into the boolean value `True`. The expected result with `evaluate=False` is to have `Lt(1, 2)` represented as `1 < 2`.",['sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py'],1,True
