astropy__astropy-13398,"1. The issue with aberration handling is related to the apparent inaccuracies when transforming from ITRS to AltAz due to differences between geocentric and topocentric aberration. The desired behavior is to have more direct and accurate transformations that account for these differences.

2. The current implementation can transform ITRS positions based on different `obstimes`, but this leads to them being treated relative to the SSB, which isn't ideal for stationary Earth objects. The proposed change is to keep ITRS positions constant over time in these specific transformations, treating them as time-invariant.

3. Currently, the transformation logic involves an intermediate step that isn't straightforward for users interested in observed frames for satellite observations. The transformation from ITRS to observed frames can result in unexpected results, partly due to the time-varying nature of current ITRS implementation coupled with aberration issues.

4. A scenario demonstrating this issue involves the inaccurate transformation of coordinates when using ITRS values of a satellite to transform to AltAz. The test case in `test_intermediate_transformations.test_straight_overhead()` showcases such inaccuracies.

4. The part of the current implementation that I suspect might be causing the issue is the logic that handles which keyword arguments are passed to the parser. As described, it seems only required arguments are passed, but it does not account for the mutually exclusive group requirement.

5. The expected behavior when `call_command` is called with keyword arguments for a command that includes a required mutually exclusive group is that it should correctly recognize the provided argument as satisfying the requirement, without throwing an error.

The main change in time zone handling between Django 3.1 and 3.2 is that the `get_tzname()` method in the `TimezoneMixin` now returns the full time zone name, like ""Etc/GMT-10"", instead of just the offset ""+10"". This affects how time zones are represented in SQL queries.

2. The issue affects the `Trunc()` and `Extract()` functions in Django's ORM, as these functions are responsible for generating the SQL queries that include time zone processing.

django__django-15277,"1. **Context of the Issue**: The `Value._resolve_output_field` method is used in Django's ORM, specifically when dealing with database expressions. Its primary function is to determine the appropriate field type to use for a given value in a query, such as when using the `annotate` method.

2. **Current Implementation Details**: In the current implementation, `CharField.__init__` automatically appends a `MaxLengthValidator` regardless of whether `max_length` is `None`. This means the validator is added every time `CharField` is instantiated, even when it's not needed.

3. **Error Scenario**: An error occurs when a `CharField` is instantiated with `max_length` as `None`, which results in a `MaxLengthValidator` that attempts to compare an integer with `None`, leading to a `TypeError` during validation.

4. **Proposed Solution Details**: The proposed solution modifies `CharField.__init__` to append the `MaxLengthValidator` only if `self.max_length` is not `None`, similar to the logic already used in `BinaryField.__init__`.

matplotlib__matplotlib-20676,"1. **Data Range and Axes Limits**: The data range is between 10 and 20. Before the issue occurs, the axes limits are expected to be (10, 20) with some margins. After creating a SpanSelector with `interactive=True`, the x-axis limits incorrectly expand to include 0 instead of remaining around 10 to 20.

2. **SpanSelector Behavior**: In the current development version, setting the SpanSelector to interactive mode causes the axes limits to expand to include 0, even though no interaction with the selector has occurred. In previous versions (e.g., Matplotlib 3.4), with `span_stays`, this behavior was not present, and the limits would remain as expected.

3. **Margins**: The specific margins aren't detailed in the issue, but normally, they would be Matplotlib's default auto margins. These margins are typically configurable in Matplotlib.

4. **Interactive Mode**: Yes, the issue seems specific to when `interactive=True` is set for the SpanSelector. It wasn't described whether similar problems occur in non-interactive mode.

3. **Reproduction Steps**: Yes, here's a minimal example to reproduce the issue:
   ```python

4. **Expected Behavior**: The ideal behavior would be to have the label spacing appear as it did in version 3.3.4, but using LaTeX formatting. The labels should be clear and well-spaced.

matplotlib__matplotlib-24870,"1. **Boolean Array Handling**: Currently, when a boolean array is passed to the `contour()` function, it defaults to 8 levels, which are spaced between 0 and 1. This results in all contour lines being drawn on top of each other, which is not useful for boolean arrays.

2. **Default Contour Level**: The default contour level for boolean arrays should be [0.5]. This effectively draws the boundary line between `True` and `False` regions.

3. **Existing Auto-Detection**: An example of existing auto-detection in the library is with `imshow()`, which automatically differentiates between 0-1 float RGBA arrays and 0-255 uint8 RGBA arrays when given a 3D array as input.

matplotlib__matplotlib-25479,"1. When creating a new colormap, you can assign it a name (e.g., `some_cmap_name`). Then, when you register this colormap with a different name (e.g., `my_cmap_name`), the internal name of the colormap (the one it's created with) and the registered name (the one used to refer to it later) differ. This difference seems to cause issues when trying to use the colormap by its registered name.

2. When using the `pyplot` interface, if you try to set or refer to a colormap by its registered name and the internal colormap object has a different name, it results in an error. Specifically, `plt.imshow()` tries to look up the colormap by its internal name rather than the registered name, leading to a `ValueError`.

3. The expected behavior is that after registering a colormap under a specific name, it should be retrievable and usable by that name through the `pyplot` interface without error, regardless of the colormap's internal name.

pydata__xarray-4966,"1. **Engine Differences**: netCDF3 only supports signed bytes and uses a convention of adding an attribute `_Unsigned=True` for handling unsigned bytes. OPeNDAP, on the other hand, natively supports unsigned bytes and uses a hack, by adding an attribute `_Unsigned=False`, to handle signed bytes. This hack is handled by the netCDF-c library but not by pydap.

2. **Current Behavior**: When using the `pydap` engine, xarray doesn't correctly recognize the signed byte hack and interprets the data incorrectly, resulting in values like 128.0 and 255.0 instead of negative values as with `netcdf4`.

3. **Expected Behavior**: The expected behavior is for xarray to correctly recognize and handle the `_Unsigned=False` attribute when using the `pydap` engine, ensuring consistent interpretation of signed bytes, similar to the `netcdf4` engine.

4. **Specific Files**: The issue might be related to the file `xarray/coding/variables.py`, particularly where xarray interprets the `_Unsigned` attribute for variables.

     import pytest

     class Foo:

   - All types of markers can be affected by this issue.
   - I don't have specific information about the exact method in the pytest codebase that handles marker resolution.

2. **Metaclass Workaround**:
   - The metaclass workaround involves merging marker values by iteratively gathering them using the method resolution order (MRO) and is demonstrated in the provided code. The metaclass gathers marker information from the entire MRO for classes inheriting from multiple parents.
   - The workaround needs to adjust for Python 2 and 3 differences in metaclass declaration.

   - The expected behavior is that markers from multiple base classes should be combined and retained for the derived class. They should not override each other but be merged.
   - There are no specific scenarios mentioned where the current behavior is intentionally acceptable.

pytest-dev__pytest-8399,"1. **Fixture Visibility Change**: Previously, unittest `setUpClass` fixtures were generated with names that started with an underscore, which meant they were considered private and were only shown in detailed views (like when using the `-v` flag with `pytest --fixtures`). Now, they are generated without the underscore and are visible by default in the fixture list.

2. **Fixture Documentation**: The fixtures should start with an underscore to indicate they are private and not displayed in the default fixture list unless verbosity is increased with the `-v` flag. This helps maintain documentation standards by not cluttering the output with internal, undocumented fixtures.

3. **CI Script Enforcement**: The CI script enforces that all public pytest fixtures must have accompanying documentation. This is done by checking the fixture list for entries without docstrings, and it fails if any public fixtures (those not starting with an underscore) are found to be undocumented.

4. **Fixture List**: Currently, these auto-generated fixtures appear as:

scikit-learn__scikit-learn-12973,"1. The conflicting values for `copy_X` occur because the `LassoLarsIC` class has a `copy_X` parameter both in its initialization and in the `fit` method. If you set `copy_X` to `False` during initialization, like `my_lasso = LassoLarsIC(copy_X=False)`, and then call `my_lasso.fit(X, y)`, the `copy_X=True` in the `fit` method will overwrite your initial setting since it has a default value of `True`.

2. The expected behavior when `copy_X` is set to `False` during initialization is that it should ideally remain `False` throughout the fitting process unless the user explicitly provides a different value when calling `fit`.

3. I haven't identified specific edge cases, but the issue is particularly problematic because the overwriting happens silently when a user doesn't specify `copy_X` in the `fit` method, especially if they expect their initial setting to persist. This can occur with any type of data or usage pattern where the assumption is that the initialization parameter will control the behavior.",[],0,0
scikit-learn__scikit-learn-13142,"1. The expected behavior when `n_init` is set to a value greater than 1 in the `GaussianMixture` class is that both the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods should return consistent and identical results after fitting the model.

2. The current behavior that leads to the discrepancy is that `fit_predict` returns the clustering from the last of the `n_init` initializations, while `predict` uses the best fit found over all `n_init` initializations. This inconsistency arises because `fit_predict` does not restore the best solution before predicting.

scikit-learn__scikit-learn-13124,"1. **Clarification on Shuffling Behavior**:
   - By ""batches,"" I mean the folds created by `StratifiedKFold`. When I say ""the order of batches is shuffled,"" it means that the order of the folds themselves is shuffled, not the individual samples within each fold.

2. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The expected behavior when `shuffle=True` in `StratifiedKFold` is that samples within each stratum should be shuffled before being split into different folds. Each fold should have a different composition of samples when different random seeds are used.

3. **Current Implementation**:

scikit-learn__scikit-learn-14710,"1. **Target Type and Encoding**: The expected type for the target labels is integers. However, when string targets are used with early stopping, the error occurs because the predictions are in string format while the true labels are integers.

2. **Error Details**: The error message is: 
   ```
   TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'float'
   ```
   The error occurs because the scorer used during early stopping gets `y_true` as integers while `y_pred` remains in the string format.

3. **Current Behavior**: Without early stopping, `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` works correctly with string targets because the target transformation happens internally during fitting and prediction.

4. **Desired Behavior**: The desired behavior would be for the classifier to automatically handle target encoding when early stopping is used, ensuring that both `y_true` and `y_pred` are in compatible formats during scoring.

5. **Additional Context**: The issue occurs during the scoring phase, specifically when scoring is computed for early stopping. The targets need to be consistently encoded during these computations.

2. **Expected Behavior**: When a variable is marked with `:meta public:`, it should be included in the generated documentation, even if it's named with a leading underscore (which generally suggests it's private). It should appear as a documented member in the generated module documentation.

3. **Current Behavior**: The current behavior is that variables with the `:meta public:` directive, like `_foo`, do not appear in the generated documentation at all.

4. **Scope of Variables**: The issue applies to variables in general, not limited to any specific type like class variables or instance variables. It affects any variable that is intended to be public but starts with an underscore.

5. **Documentation Generation**: The documentation is being generated using Sphinx, with the module being documented in an `.rst` file that uses the `automodule` directive, like this:
   ```rst
   # index.rst
   .. automodule:: example
      :members:

   ```

   index.rst:28: WARNING: more than one target found for cross-reference 'A': mod.A, mod.submod.A
   index.rst:43: WARNING: more than one target found for cross-reference 'A': mod.A, mod.submod.A
   index.rst:43: WARNING: more than one target found for cross-reference 'A': mod.A, mod.submod.A
   ```
   These warnings refer to the unqualified type names `A`.

2. **Implicit Cross-References**: The `:type:` and `:rtype:` fields are used to annotate the parameter types and the return type of functions. They automatically create cross-references to the given types, and the issue is that for unqualified names, the lookup seems to search across all (sub)modules rather than following the module hierarchy.

3. **Hierarchical Module Structure**: There is a hierarchical module structure like this:
   - `mod` module, which contains:
     - Class `A`.
     - `submod` submodule, which contains:
       - Class `A`.

4. **Expected Behavior**: When resolving types, in the context of `mod.submod`, unqualified references to `A` should resolve to `mod.submod.A`, not `mod.A`. Similarly, within `mod`, an unqualified reference to `A` should resolve to `mod.A`.

The expected output in the documentation is:
```
ugly_enum_func(e: ugly_enum.MyEnum = MyEnum.ValueA) → None
```

The actual output is:
```
ugly_enum_func(e: ugly_enum.MyEnum = <MyEnum.ValueA: 10>) → None
```

2. **Function Signature**: An example of a function signature that includes this Enum:

```python
def ugly_enum_func(e: 'ugly_enum.MyEnum' = MyEnum.ValueA) -> None:
    pass

It is currently being rendered as:
```

3. **Sphinx Configuration**: The Sphinx setup uses the `autodoc` extension, but there are no specific configurations or custom directives mentioned that are relevant to this issue.

4. **Documentation Format**: The documentation is being generated in HTML format.

5. **Additional Context**: A workaround is suggested by providing a `__repr__` implementation in the Enum class until the issue is potentially addressed by the Python community:

This specific issue was fixed in `sphinx 3.4.2`. However, starting from `sphinx 3.4.2`, there's a problem with the ""Bases"" section where the base class is incorrectly documented.

2. **Project Setup**: We are using mocked classes in our project, specifically classes inherited from mocked versions of external libraries such as `torch.nn.Module`. The mocking process is part of our Sphinx configuration to handle dependencies that are not installed by default.

sympy__sympy-13031,"1. **Expected Behavior**: In SymPy version 1.0, when using the `hstack` function to concatenate matrices with zero rows, it would combine the matrices and return a shape representing the sum of columns from all matrices, while keeping the row count as zero. For example, concatenating four matrices with shapes (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), and (0, 3) would result in a matrix with the shape (0, 6).

2. **Actual Behavior**: In SymPy version 1.1, using the same operation with `hstack` on matrices with zero rows results in a shape that only includes the columns from the matrix with the largest column count. So, concatenating matrices with shapes (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), and (0, 3) would incorrectly result in a shape (0, 3).

3. Yes, the issue occurs when trying to achieve a row-style HNF using flips and transposes. For example, with the matrix `[[5, 8, 12], [0, 0, 1]]`, I expect `[[5, 8, 0], [0, 0, 1]]`, but I get `[[5, 8, 0]]`.

4. The problem seems to depend on the position of the 1 in the matrix when computing the HNF. If the 1 is in different rows, it affects the result.",['sympy/polys/matrices/normalforms.py'],1,0
sympy__sympy-23950,"1. The `Contains.as_set` method is expected to return a set. If `Contains(x, set).as_set()` is called and `x` is a symbol, it should return `set`. If `Contains` evaluates to False, it should return `EmptySet`.

2. An example of the current incorrect behavior:
   ```python
   >>> Contains(x, Reals).as_set()
   Contains(x, Reals)
   ```
   The expected correct behavior is:
   ```python
   Reals
   ```

3. The fix should handle the case where `Contains` evaluates to False, returning `EmptySet` instead of potentially incorrect results. It should also consider `Boolean` expressions, ensuring they return a `ConditionSet` when applicable, although this is less about edge cases and more about consistent behavior.",[],0,0
sympy__sympy-23262,"1. Sure, here's a specific example: When using `lambdify` with a tuple containing a single element like this:

```python
import inspect
from sympy import lambdify

inspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))
```

SymPy 1.10 returns:

```
'def _lambdifygenerated():\n    return (1)\n'
```

2. The expected output for this example should be:

```
'def _lambdifygenerated():\n    return (1,)\n'
```

Note the comma, which ensures the return type is a tuple instead of an integer.

sympy__sympy-23824,"1. **Context of the Issue**: The `kahane_simplify()` function is designed to simplify products of gamma matrices by applying identities like $\gamma^\mu \gamma_\mu = 4 I_4$. It handles inputs in the form of gamma matrix products, where some of the matrices are contracted.

2. **Specifics of the Bug**: The bug appears when there are leading gamma matrices without contractions. When these matrices are simplified, they incorrectly reverse the order of the leading uncontracted gamma matrices.

3. **Expected vs. Actual Behavior**: The expected behavior is that expressions like $\gamma^\mu \gamma_\mu \gamma^\rho \gamma^\sigma$ and $\gamma^\rho \gamma^\sigma \gamma^\mu \gamma_\mu$ both simplify to $4\gamma^\rho \gamma^\sigma$. The actual behavior is that the order of $\gamma^\rho$ and $\gamma^\sigma$ is flipped in the second case.

4. **Relevant Code Sections**: I identified that the issue occurs because the leading gamma matrices are removed and then inserted in reverse order at the end of the function. The loop responsible for this insertion is backward.

5. **Edge Cases**: I haven't identified specific edge cases, but it seems to occur generally when there are leading uncontracted gamma matrices before a contracted pair.",[],0,0

2. An example input that causes the error is the expression `a1*t1 + v1` using the Python code provided. The expected result would be that the function recognizes `a1*t1` has the same dimension as `v1` (velocity), but it raises an error instead.

2. By ""inverted generators,"" I mean that when `r[i]` is an inverse of one of the generators, the `in gens` check fails. The test is likely expecting the generator itself, not its inverse.

3. I think the whole logic around checking membership in `gens` for elements that can be an inverse should be simplified. This might involve handling inverted generators differently or adjusting the condition.

4. I haven't tested extensively for edge cases, but the error occurred with the Dihedral group `D3` when using the `homomorphism` function with its own generators. So scenarios involving inverses seem to be problematic.",[],0,0
