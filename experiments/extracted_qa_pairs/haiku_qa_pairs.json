Sure, when using a nested compound model like `m.Pix2Sky_TAN() & cm` where `cm` is `m.Linear1D(10) & m.Linear1D(5)`, the separability matrix output is unexpected. The matrix reflects that the inputs and outputs are no longer separable, which seems incorrect given the simplicity of the linear models.\n\n3.

I believe this issue is occurring in the area related to QuerySet evaluation, specifically when altering the list of columns in composed queries within Django's ORM.\n\n3. The unexpected behavior is that the list of columns does not change as expected when evaluating `values()` or `values_list()` multiple times. In the example, the expected result when calling `values_list('order')` should have only returned the `order` value, but instead, it returns both `name` and `order`."

You then create a subclass `Book` and move the `title` field from `Readable` to `Book` in one migration step. This leads to a `FieldError` when running `migrate`, due to a clash of the `title` field on `Book` from the base class `Readable` that still has the field at the start of the migration.\n\n2.

Existing tokens will become invalid because their hash value no longer matches the new hash value that includes the updated email.\n\nThe modification ensures that:\n- Changing the email address will invalidate all existing password reset tokens\n- The token generation process now incorporates the user's current email\n- The change is minimal and does not require extensive modifications to the authentication system\n\nTo verify the changes, I would typically create a test script.

Let me break down what I understand and ask a follow-up question.\n\nThe issue seems to be related to the order-dependent behavior of QuerySet OR operations, specifically when the QuerySets involve complex relationships with multiple joins and filters. The key observation is that `qs2 | qs1` works fine, but `qs1 | qs2` raises an AssertionError due to alias conflicts.\n\nBefore I dive into implementing a solution, I have one clarifying question:\n\nCould you confirm the exact error message or traceback that is raised when `qs1 | qs2` is executed? This will help me pinpoint the specific location in the Django ORM where the alias conflict occurs.\n\nAlso, to ensure I fully understand the context, could you briefly outline the model definitions for `Foo`, `Qux`, `Bar`, and `Baz`? The model relationships seem crucial to understanding the alias conflict.",
        "The exact error message or traceback when `qs1 | qs2` is executed is:\n\n```\nAssertionError\n\"/django/db/models/sql/query.py\", line 854, in Query.change_aliases\nchange_map = {'T4': 'T5', 'T5': 'T6'}\n```\n\nAs for the model definitions, here they are:\n\n```python\n# models.py\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Foo(models.Model):\n    qux = models.ForeignKey(\"app.Qux\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name=\"foos\")\n\nclass Bar(models.Model):\n    foo = models.ForeignKey(\"app.Foo\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name=\"bars\")\n    another_foo = models.ForeignKey(\"app.Foo\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name=\"other_bars\")\n    baz = models.ForeignKey(\"app.Baz\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name=\"bars\")\n\nclass Baz(models.Model):\n    pass\n\nclass Qux(models.Model):\n    bazes = models.ManyToManyField(\"app.Baz\", related_name=\"quxes\")\n```\n\nThese relationships contribute to the complexity of joins and potential alias conflicts during the QuerySet operations."

Yes, we are using this custom Sphinx extension to perform the replacement. The replacement operation is integrated into the documentation build process through the `source-read` event. The way it's supposed to work is that the `source-read` event is triggered for every document, and the specified string replacements are applied wherever applicable.

Yes, here is a minimal code example demonstrating the issue:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import Mod, lambdify, symbols\n\nx, y = symbols('x y')\nexpr = -Mod(x, y)\ng = lambdify([x, y], expr, modules=[])\nprint(g(3, 7))  # Expected output: -3, Actual output: 4\n```\n\n2. I don't have the exact file, but the `lambdify` function is part of the SymPy utilities module, so it should be in a file related to utilities.\n\n3. The transformation observed is that when using `lambdify` with an empty `modules` list, the expression `-Mod(x, y)` is incorrectly transformed to `-x % y` instead of the expected Python expression equivalent to `-Mod(x, y)`, resulting in incorrect behavior."

        "1. Currently, the `codegen.ast` `String` class does not support the argument invariance where `expr.func(*expr.args) == expr`. This means that when you reconstruct an object using its function and arguments, it should equal the original object. Instead, it currently uses `expr.func(**expr.kwargs()) == expr`, but the expected behavior for a `Basic` subclass is the former.\n\n2. The \"different form of invariance\" refers to the fact that instead of reconstructing using `*expr.args`, it's using `**expr.kwargs()`. The issue is that reconstruction should be consistent with the typical form used by `Basic` subclasses, which is using positional arguments.\n\n3. For SymPy's `Basic` class, argument invariance means that when you take a function (`func`) and its arguments (`args`), and you recreate the object using these, it should be identical to the original object. It's about ensuring consistency in object reconstruction using the function and its positional arguments."
