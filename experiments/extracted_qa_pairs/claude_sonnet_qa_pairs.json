In Django 3.2, there seems to be a change in how Q object aliases are set up when using OR conditions, leading to all fields being added in the get_default_columns on the aliases, unlike in 2.2.5. This results in a \"subquery must return only one column\" error.\n\n3. The issue arises because of the selection of all default columns for `agent__property_groups__in`. The expected behavior is to select only the necessary column, similar to how `agent__property_groups__id__in` operates, which only selects the `id` column.\n\n4. The SQL query that's generated incorrectly includes multiple columns from the subquery instead of just one. For example:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT U0.\"id\", U0.\"created\", U0.\"updated\", U0.\"create_by\", U0.\"update_by\", U0.\"tenant_objs\", U0.\"name\" \n   ```\n\n   These additional columns (`created`, `updated`, `create_by`, etc.) should not be part of the subquery, and only the `id` should be selected for the operation to succeed."

Sure, here's what I can provide:\n   - The expected behavior is that when you rotate your secret key and include the old one in SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS, existing user sessions should remain valid until the fallback keys are removed.\n   - The actual behavior is that rotating the secret key is causing users to be logged out, indicating that the fallback keys are not being utilized for sessions.\n   - There doesn't seem to be a specific timing or order of operations; the logout happens immediately when the keys are rotated.\n\n2. Regarding the documentation:\n   - The part of the documentation that describes the process of rotating secret keys and using SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS might be incorrect.\n   - The specific claim that doesn't match the behavior is the suggestion that adding a key to SECRET_KEY_FALLBACKS should keep sessions valid, which isn't happening.\n\n3.

The specific difference in label spacing is that in version 3.4.3, the labels are incorrectly spaced when rendered with LaTeX. In version 3.3.4, the labels are clearer, but it seems they weren't actually rendered with LaTeX. The issue affects the major ticks.\n\n4. The problem occurs with general LaTeX text, particularly involving `\\text` and spacing not being correctly maintained in LaTeX rendering of datetime labels."

        "1. The mismatch occurs when I create a custom colormap with one name (`some_cmap_name`) and register it with another name (`my_cmap_name`). When I try to use the registered name with `plt.set_cmap('my_cmap_name')`, it seems to fallback to the colormap's internal name and not the registered name, causing a lookup failure.\n\n2. It appears specifically related to how the `set_cmap` function in `pyplot` handles the colormap names. The registered name isn't used correctly, leading to the error.\n\n3. The issue becomes apparent when I import a colormap from another module, register it with a new name, and attempt to use this new name. It doesn't necessarily have to be from external libraries, it's more about registering it under a different alias within the same environment."

        "1. The code example demonstrating the inconsistent behavior is included in the initial bug report. It shows varying behaviors when `mincnt` and the `C` parameter are used with the `hexbin` function.

The expected behavior is that with `mincnt` set to `1`, the function should display grid points that contain at least one datum both when `C` is specified and when it's not. Currently, when `C` is specified, it unexpectedly requires at least two data points for grid points to be shown.\n\n3.

It should actually be resolved to `docs/modules/submodule/MyClass.html#my_module.MyClass`.\n\n2. The 404 errors are occurring for all the links within the SVG inheritance diagrams, not just specific types. This includes class links and any other links within the diagrams.\n\n3. In SVG format, the links are formatted relatively to the file the SVG is embedded on, causing issues when the embedding file is not in the root directory. For example, the link might appear as `../MyClass.html`. In the default image format (like PNG), these relative path issues don't occur, as the generation method seems to handle paths more correctly or perhaps the links aren't embedded in the same way. I hope this helps clarify the differences!"
