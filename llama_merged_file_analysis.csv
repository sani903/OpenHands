It allows `Quantity` to interact with NumPy's universal functions, handling units correctly according to the operation being performed.

2. The specific inputs that should return `NotImplemented` are those where the left operand is not an instance of `Quantity`, and when inputs have equivalent but different units. In my case, this happened when using a duck type of `Quantity` with incompatible units.

astropy__astropy-13398,"1. Currently, transformations from ITRS to observed frames like AltAz and HADec can be inaccurate due to the difference between geocentric and topocentric aberration. The transformation refers to the ITRS coordinates as geocentric, which can result in issues when they should consider the observer's topocentric position on Earth.

2. The proposed solution aims to simplify the process by using a direct transformation approach within the ITRS framework, treating ITRS positions as time-invariant. This means ignoring changes in `obstime` for these specific transformations, to avoid unnecessary complexity and errors caused by referencing coordinates to the Solar System Barycenter (SSB) instead of the rotating Earth.

3. Focus on modifying files related to the ITRS and transformation logic, including:
   - `astropy/coordinates/builtin_frames/itrs.py`
   - `astropy/coordinates/builtin_frames/intermediate_rotation_transforms.py`
   - New file: `astropy/coordinates/builtin_frames/itrs_observed_transforms.py`

4. I haven't mentioned anything about changes to any test files in the description. You'll want to ensure that new transformations have appropriate test coverage, but I haven't provided specific information about test file locations or contents.

5. Consider edge cases such as input coordinates without distances and handling invalid or nonsensical input combinations. It's important to ensure proper error handling and meaningful feedback for users when inputs might not fit the intended use case of ground-based observations looking at near-Earth objects. 1. The direct transformation approach involves creating a transformation matrix that stays within the ITRS and converts between ITRS and observed frames using rotation matrices. The proposed solution uses these matrices to transform topocentric ITRS positions to AltAz or HADec coordinates, and vice versa. The key is to accurately model the observer's position on Earth.

2. The new file `astropy/coordinates/builtin_frames/itrs_observed_transforms.py` should contain transformation functions specifically for ITRS to AltAz and ITRS to HADec transformations. It can include necessary computation logic using matrix transformations, rotation matrices, and handling of observer's position.

3. For error handling, ensure that exceptions are raised for invalid inputs or incompatible configurations, and provide informative error messages. Follow existing patterns in the Astropy codebase for consistency, using custom exceptions where appropriate.

4. You can use existing tests in the Astropy repository as a reference for writing new tests. Look for tests related to coordinate transformations to understand test structure and methodology. Create new tests to cover the new transformations, focusing on edge cases and typical use scenarios.

5. Adhere to the Astropy coding guidelines, which include following PEP 8 for Python code style, writing clear and concise docstrings, and using descriptive names for variables and functions.

The issue arises from improper whitespace when specifying ordering options (like descending order) and opclasses in the CREATE INDEX SQL statement due to a bug in how Django handles these parameters. To reproduce the issue, you can create a simple Django model and define an index with ordering options and/or opclasses. Here is an example:

2. Use a testcase that simulates the query scenario:

   - Use `SimpleLazyObject` to delay the creation of a `User` object.

django__django-15695,"The RenameIndex function is part of Django's migration operations and can be located in the file `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`. Its purpose is to handle the renaming of indexes within the database schema during migrations. It should manage both named and unnamed indexes, especially dealing with those created by the `unique_together` attribute in models. The crash you're mentioning on PostgreSQL occurs because the old auto-generated name of an unnamed index doesn't get restored when moving backward through a migration, leading to a conflict as there's already an index with the name ""new_pony_test_idx"" when reapplying RenameIndex. Certainly! An example of a model using the `unique_together` attribute is as follows:

```python
from django.db import models

class MyModel(models.Model):

    field_two = models.CharField(max_length=255)

    class Meta:
        unique_together = (('field_one', 'field_two'),)
```

This configuration will create an unnamed index that the RenameIndex function would need to handle. To create a migration applying the RenameIndex operation in Django, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create Initial Migration:** First, generate an initial migration for your model:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   ```

2. **Modify the Migration File:** Locate the migration file created in the `migrations` directory within your app. Open the migration file and find the operations list. Manually add the `RenameIndex` operation like this:

   ```python
   from django.db import migrations

   class Migration(migrations.Migration):

       dependencies = [
           # Add previous migration dependencies here
       ]

       operations = [

               new_name='new_pony_test_idx',  # Specify old and new index names here
           ),
       ]
   ```
   Note: Adjust the `model_name` and `new_name` to fit your test case.

Regarding the `include` directive, the issue arises because the `source-read` event, which our extension relies on for modifications, does not modify the source of included files. Consequently, included files are left out of the search and replace mechanism, leading to inconsistencies in the final HTML output. Certainly! In the Yocto documentation, the `include` directive is used in reStructuredText (reST) files to include content from another file. For example, it might look like this in a `.rst` file:

```reStructuredText
This is a test
==============

.. include:: something-to-include.rst

&REPLACE_ME;
```

The `yocto-vars.py` extension performs search and replace operations on placeholders within the text. For instance, it replaces occurrences of `&REPLACE_ME;` with the desired text, such as ""REPLACED."" However, this replacement does not happen in the included `something-to-include.rst` file due to the issue with the `source-read` event not affecting included files.",[],0,0

This `Poly` object `poly` will exhibit the unstripped leading zero issue after using the `clear_denoms()` function.

And yes, the `Poly` class and the `clear_denoms()` function are part of SymPy, which is generally located in the `sympy` directory within the repository.",[],0,0
sympy__sympy-24562,"The discrepancy occurs when using the inputs: `Rational('0.5', '100')`. With SymPy 1.11.1, the result is `1/100100`, but it should be `1/200`. The expected result with the correct calculation can be achieved by using `Rational(0.5, 100)`, which correctly yields `1/200`. This issue didn't exist in SymPy 1.8.",[],0,0
sympy__sympy-21930,"The expected output is that the superscript should be correctly interpreted using curly brackets, like `""{b^\dagger_{0}}^{2}""`, to display it properly in LaTeX. The actual output shows the superscript directly as `""b^\dagger_{0}^{2}""`, which doesn't render correctly. I'm not aware of any specific LaTeX packages or configurations being used in the ""secondquant"" module.",[],0,0
sphinx-doc__sphinx-10435,"The issue is with the Docutiles `code` role, activated by the enhancement from #10251 for syntax highlighting. In LaTeX output, a space is added at the start and end of inline code. The expected behavior is that these spaces should not be present. No specific configuration options or settings were mentioned as relevant to this issue. Yes, you can generally assume that the `doc` directory contains documentation source files, and the `sphinx` directory contains the Sphinx code. 

The expected output of the LaTeX compilation should not have extra spaces at the start and end of the inline code block in the PDF. You can verify this by compiling the LaTeX output with `make latexpdf` and comparing the inline code sections in the generated PDF against the source to check for unwanted spaces. Additionally, inspecting the `.tex` file directly for unexpected whitespace in the inline code can help verify the issue.",[],0,0
