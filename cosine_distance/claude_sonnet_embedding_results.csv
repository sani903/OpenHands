3. `NotImplemented` should be returned when the inputs are incompatible, specifically meaning when their units cannot be directly operated together, as in different units like meters and millimeters without an automatic conversion in place. This should be handled specifically for duck types that aren't directly recognized as `Quantity` or convertible to `ndarray` within the current implementation.","The issue discusses whether the `Quantity.__array_ufunc__()` method in the Astropy library should return `NotImplemented` instead of raising a `ValueError` when inputs are incompatible.

Can you provide an example of the version strings that trigger this TypeError? This will help me reproduce the issue.
What was the alternative version parsing method that was removed? Understanding this might help guide the solution.
In what specific context or function call does this error occur? (e.g., is it during package installation, version checking, etc.?)

Let me know these details so I can proceed with exploring the repository and implementing a fix.","1. The version strings that trigger this `TypeError` are '1.14.3' and '1.14dev'.

2. The alternative version parsing method that was previously used and could handle this correctly was `pkg_resources.parse_version`.

3. This error occurs during version checking, specifically in the `minversion` function when determining if a module's version meets a minimum requirement.","The issue involves a failure in the `minversion` function due to a change in a pull request, which leads to a `TypeError` when comparing certain version strings.

Are there any specific Django model field types that are affected by this issue (e.g., CharField, IntegerField), or does it affect all field types that accept Enum values as defaults?

When you mention ""the Enum's value instead of its name"", could you clarify if this is specifically about the migration file content? For example, if we have `class Color(Enum): RED = 1`, does the migration file currently store `1` when it should store `'RED'`?

These questions will help me understand the core issue better and implement a targeted solution. Please provide any examples or specific scenarios that would help illustrate the problem.","1. In the models.py file, we're using an Enum object as a default value for a CharField. For instance:

```python
from enum import Enum
from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
from django.db import models

    GOOD = _('Good') 
    BAD = _('Bad') 

class Item(models.Model):
    status = models.CharField(default=Status.GOOD, max_length=128)
```

The generated migration file incorrectly uses the Enum's translated value, leading to an error like `ValueError: 'Good' is not a valid Status` after translation, as 'Good' is translated to another language and no longer recognized as a valid Enum value.

2. As far as I'm aware, this issue affects any field type that can accept Enum values as defaults, with the specific example being a CharField. I'm not sure if it affects other field types directly.

3. Yes, this is specifically about the migration file content. In the migration, the Enum's translated value is being stored instead of its name. For example, if we have `class Color(Enum): RED = 1`, scenario similar to my case would store `'1'` (or its translation if it were translatable) instead of `'RED'`.","The issue involves the use of Enum objects as default values in Django model fields, where the generated migration files incorrectly use the Enum's value instead of its name. This leads to errors when the Enum values are translated into different languages, as the migration files no longer recognize the translated values.

2. The unexpected behavior is in the sorting order of the query results. The results appear in a descending order due to the default sort order on the `OneModel` class, whereas I expect the order specified in `order_by()` to take precedence. Here’s a sample query that reproduces the issue:

   ```python
   qs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])
   qs = qs.order_by(""record__root_id"")

   - Simple model deletes vs cascade deletes?
   - Single record deletes vs bulk deletes?
   - Models with foreign key relationships vs standalone models?

Identify exactly where in the query compilation process the subquery is being introduced
Determine if we need to modify the query generation logic in `compiler.py` or the deletion logic in `deletion.py`
Ensure the fix maintains proper locking semantics while improving performance","1. In Django 3.0, the SQL for the delete operation is: `DELETE FROM testapp_alphabet`. In Django 3.1, it changes to: `DELETE FROM testapp_alphabet WHERE testapp_alphabet.id IN (SELECT testapp_alphabet.id FROM testapp_alphabet)`. The subquery is introduced in Django 3.1.

2. This locking issue is most problematic in MySQL, as discussed in the MySQL documentation regarding `LOCK TABLES`.

3. A minimal model structure that reproduces the issue involves a simple model with an integer primary key. The performance regression is more noticeable with bulk deletes of multiple records, especially on a table with a significant number of rows, like 100,000. There's no specific mention of foreign key relationships or cascading deletes being more problematic.","There is a performance regression issue related to the use of subqueries in delete operations with Django 3.1, which affects the ability to use table locks effectively.

Please provide these details so I can implement the most appropriate solution.","1. Sure, when a Q object has a single child that's not a Q object, it's deconstructed into kwargs. For example, `Q(x=1).deconstruct()` results in `('django.db.models.Q', (), {'x': 1})`. But for multiple children, it's deconstructed into args like `Q(x=1, y=2).deconstruct()` which gives `('django.db.models.Q', (('x', 1), ('y', 2)), {})`.

2. The specific error when deconstructing Q objects with non-subscriptable children like Exists objects is a `TypeError`. The issue arises because the code assumes that a single child can be treated as a key-value pair, which is not valid for objects like Exists. The error message typically says: `'Exists' object is not subscriptable`.

Since the issue is about BETWEEN vs EXTRACT, could you share what SQL is currently being generated for the filter case and what SQL should be generated instead? This would help pinpoint exactly where the optimization is going wrong.

Please provide these details so I can better understand the problem and implement an effective solution.","1. Sure, when using the `__iso_year` filter, the query ends up using a `BETWEEN` clause instead of the expected `EXTRACT` operation. For example:
   ```python
   DTModel.objects.filter(start_date__iso_year=2020).only('id').query
   ```
   generates:
   ```sql
   SELECT ""db_functions_dtmodel"".""id"" FROM ""db_functions_dtmodel"" WHERE ""db_functions_dtmodel"".""start_date"" BETWEEN 2020-01-01 AND 2020-12-31
   ```
   This is incorrect for filtering by ISO year.

2. The difference is that annotations correctly use the `EXTRACT` operation, while filters incorrectly use `BETWEEN`. For example:
   ```python
   Model.objects.annotate(iso_year=ExtractIsoYear('date_field'))
   ```
   generates:
   ```sql
   SELECT ..., EXTRACT('isoyear' FROM ""model_table"".""date_field"") AS ""iso_year"" FROM ""model_table""

   ```python
   Model.objects.filter(date_field__iso_year=some_year)

   ```sql
   WHERE ""model_table"".""date_field"" BETWEEN some_year-01-01 AND some_year-12-31
   ```

3. Currently, SQL for the filter case generates a `BETWEEN` clause:
   ```sql
   WHERE ""db_functions_dtmodel"".""start_date"" BETWEEN 2020-01-01 AND 2020-12-31
   ```
   What should be generated is an `EXTRACT` operation for filtering by ISO year:
   ```sql
   WHERE EXTRACT('isoyear' FROM ""db_functions_dtmodel"".""start_date"") = some_year
   ```","There is an issue with query optimization in the YearLookup functionality that affects filtering by ""__iso_year"". The optimization incorrectly applies a BETWEEN operation instead of using the EXTRACT function, leading to incorrect data being returned when filtering by ISO year. This problem has persisted since the introduction of ExtractIsoYear in Django 2.2, and it specifically impacts filters using the lookup, although annotations work correctly. A proposed fix aims to address this behavior and correct the related tests."

This will help me understand the exact scenario where the problem occurs.

You mentioned a change in behavior between Django 2.2.5 and 3.2. Can you elaborate on what exactly changed in the SQL generation or column selection logic between these versions?

The PR description mentions ""incorrect default column selection"". Could you specify which columns are being incorrectly selected and what the expected columns should be?

When you say ""a subquery returns multiple columns instead of one"", can you provide an example of the SQL query that's being generated and what columns are being incorrectly included?

This will help me understand where exactly in the code I need to make changes to fix the issue.","1. An example of a query that triggers this issue is when you use Q objects with OR conditions like this:

   ```python
   queryset.filter(
       Q(agent__property_groups__in=property_groups)
       | Q(agent__property_groups__count=0)
   ).distinct()
   ```

   This used to work in Django 2.2.5 but causes an error in 3.2.

2. In Django 3.2, there seems to be a change in how Q object aliases are set up when using OR conditions, leading to all fields being added in the get_default_columns on the aliases, unlike in 2.2.5. This results in a ""subquery must return only one column"" error.

3. The issue arises because of the selection of all default columns for `agent__property_groups__in`. The expected behavior is to select only the necessary column, similar to how `agent__property_groups__id__in` operates, which only selects the `id` column.

4. The SQL query that's generated incorrectly includes multiple columns from the subquery instead of just one. For example:

   ```sql
   SELECT U0.""id"", U0.""created"", U0.""updated"", U0.""create_by"", U0.""update_by"", U0.""tenant_objs"", U0.""name"" 
   ```

   These additional columns (`created`, `updated`, `create_by`, etc.) should not be part of the subquery, and only the `id` should be selected for the operation to succeed.","There is an issue with how Q objects handle aliasing when using OR conditions in Django queries. Specifically, a change in behavior between Django versions 2.2.5 and 3.2 causes a subquery to return multiple columns instead of one, leading to a ProgrammingError.

   - What is the expected behavior of `allow_migrate` in this case?
   - Are there any specific error messages or unexpected behaviors you're seeing?

In the multi-database setup:
   - How many databases are typically involved?
   - Are there specific types of models that should only migrate to certain databases?
   - Is this issue affecting all migrations or only specific types of migrations?

Regarding the `MigrationRecorder`:
   - Is the issue that it's creating its own tables in all databases, or is it trying to apply all migrations to all databases?
   - Are there any specific database operations or migration types that trigger this issue more frequently?

Please provide these details so I can better understand the problem and implement an appropriate solution.","1. Example Scenario and Configuration:
   - The database router configuration is a simple one where we use a class `Router` with a method `allow_migrate`. It looks like this:
     ```python
     class Router(object):
         def allow_migrate(self, db, model):
             if db == 'default':
                 return True
             return False
     ```
   - The expected behavior is that migrations should only occur on the 'default' connection, and not on any other database connections.
   - There are no specific error messages mentioned, but the unexpected behavior is that `migrate` is being called on all connections, attempting to create migration tables on non-default connections.

2. Multi-Database Setup:
   - Typically, there is one main database and several other connections to different databases.
   - Models with `managed = False` should only read from certain databases but never have migrations applied to them.
   - The issue appears to affect all migrations where Django tries to record applied migrations in all databases, not just the 'default'.

3. MigrationRecorder Issue:
   - The issue is primarily that the `MigrationRecorder` is attempting to create tables in all databases rather than respecting the `allow_migrate` router rules.
   - This is problematic during test setups when `migrate` runs on every connection, despite some databases being read-only or specific to unmanaged models.","The issue involves a multi-database setup in a Django project where the `MigrationRecorder` does not respect the `db_router`'s `allow_migrate` rules. The expectation is that migrations should only be applied to the default database connection, but currently, the migration process attempts to create tables in all connections. This behavior is problematic as it disregards the routing logic intended to restrict migrations to a specific database."

   - When a callable storage is provided that returns `default_storage`, the original code would not include the storage in the deconstructed kwargs because it only checked `if self.storage is not default_storage`
   - This led to inconsistent migration files because the storage argument would be omitted even though it was explicitly provided as a callable

The Fix:
   - Changed the condition to `if hasattr(self, ""_storage_callable"") or self.storage is not default_storage`
   - This ensures that if a callable was provided (tracked by `_storage_callable`), it will be included in the deconstructed kwargs regardless of what it returns
   - This maintains the original behavior for non-callable storage values (only included if different from default_storage)

Edge Cases Handled:
   - Direct default_storage: Still omitted from kwargs (Test 1)
   - Callable returning default_storage: Now properly included in kwargs (Test 2)
   - Callable returning custom storage: Already handled correctly
   - Non-callable custom storage: Already handled correctly

The fix ensures that when a callable is provided as the storage argument, it will always be preserved in migrations, which is the expected behavior since the callable itself is part of the field's configuration, regardless of what storage instance it returns.

This change is minimal and focused on fixing the specific issue without introducing any potential side effects. It maintains backward compatibility while ensuring consistent migration file generation.",Thanks for the explanation! Could you confirm if the issue arises with any callable or just when it returns `default_storage`?,"There is an issue with the deconstruction of a FileField in Django when the storage argument is set to a callable that can return the default storage.

   - Does it happen with any specific serialization format (JSON, XML, etc.)?

The error message during serialization is: `django.core.exceptions.FieldError: Field TestTag.master cannot be both deferred and traversed using select_related at the same time.`

2. The error occurs when serializing a model instance with a many-to-many field using Django's built-in serialization. It specifically happens with the JSON format.

3. Here's the example of the model structure and custom manager code causing the issue:

```python
class TestTagManager(Manager):
    def get_queryset(self):
        qs = super().get_queryset()
        qs = qs.select_related(""master"")
        return qs

    objects = TestTagManager()
    name = models.CharField(max_length=120)
    master = models.ForeignKey(TestTagMaster, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)

class Test(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=120)
    tags = models.ManyToManyField(TestTag, blank=True)
```

When serializing an instance of `Test`, the error is raised.","There is an issue with serializing a many-to-many relationship in Django when using a custom manager that employs `select_related`. The problem arises because the serialization process encounters a `FieldError`, indicating that a field cannot be both deferred and traversed with `select_related` simultaneously.

When comparing the behavior with line objects (which work correctly), what's the key difference in how they handle dash offsets? This would help pinpoint where the patch implementation diverges.

Please provide these details so I can better understand the issue and implement an effective solution.","1. The issue manifests when using a dash tuple like `(0, (10, 10))` for patch edges. The expected outcome is that the dash pattern starts with an offset, but in the actual outcome, the offset has no effect, causing the lines to overlap incorrectly, unlike how they're rendered for `Line2D` objects.

2. The issue affects all patch objects uniformly, as demonstrated with both `Rectangle` and `Ellipse`.

3. It's noticeable with both simple and complex dash patterns. The specific pattern doesn't matter as the offset part of the tuple is ignored entirely for patches.

4. For lines, `Line2D` correctly interprets and applies the offset in dash patterns, using the provided offset to start the dash sequence at the right position. The key difference is in the implementation where patch handling code seems to ignore the offset completely.
","There is an issue with the rendering of dashed line styles in patch objects where the specified offset in the dash pattern does not affect the appearance as expected. This problem is observed across different patch types and operating systems, indicating a potential inconsistency in how dash offsets are applied to patch edges compared to line objects."

   The inconsistency appears in the right subplot where `histtype='step'`.

2. The issue appears when the data is multiplied by a constant, such as the `scale` in the example. This rescaling leads to inconsistent density axis scaling in the `step` histogram.

3. I haven't tested extensively for different data ranges or bin configurations. However, using `bins=100` with a `scale=1.2` in the example seems to consistently reproduce the issue. Adjusting the scale or number of bins might also show the problem, but I haven't explored that fully.","There is an issue with the `matplotlib.axes.Axes.hist` function where the density axis is not automatically adjusted when using `histtype='step'` and `density=True`.

This will help me understand the exact behavior and create a reproduction script.

What is the expected behavior of `mincnt` parameter in both cases (with and without `C`)? From the description, it seems when `C` is not specified, grid points with at least one data point are shown (mincnt=1), but when `C` is specified, it requires at least two points (mincnt=2). Is this understanding correct?

Which behavior should be considered the ""correct"" one - should grid points be shown with at least one data point (mincnt=1) in both cases, or should they require at least two points (mincnt=2) in both cases?

Please provide these details so I can proceed with implementing the fix.","1. The code example demonstrating the inconsistent behavior is included in the initial bug report. It shows varying behaviors when `mincnt` and the `C` parameter are used with the `hexbin` function. The relevant snippet is as follows:

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(42)
X, Y = np.random.multivariate_normal([0.0, 0.0], [[1.0, 0.1], [0.1, 1.0]], size=250).T
Z = np.ones_like(X)  # or any specific computation

fig, ax = pyplot.subplots(1, 1)
ax.hexbin(
    X, Y,
    C=Z,
    reduce_C_function=np.sum,
    mincnt=1,
    gridsize=(7, 7),
    linewidth=0.0,
    cmap='Blues',
)
ax.set_facecolor(""green"")
```

2. The expected behavior is that with `mincnt` set to `1`, the function should display grid points that contain at least one datum both when `C` is specified and when it's not. Currently, when `C` is specified, it unexpectedly requires at least two data points for grid points to be shown.

3. The correct behavior should be consistent across both scenarios, with grid points displayed if they contain at least one datum (`mincnt=1`) regardless of whether `C` is specified or not. This would align the behavior with user expectations and ensure consistency.","There is an inconsistency in the behavior of the `hexbin` function's `mincnt` parameter in Matplotlib, which varies depending on whether the `C` parameter is provided. The issue arises when the expected behavior of plotting grid points with at least one datum is not consistent across different configurations of the `C` parameter. The user suggests a change to unify the behavior regardless of the `C` parameter's presence."

   - Are there any specific style settings or themes that trigger this behavior?

Regarding the multiplicative offset:
   - What's the expected behavior for handling the offset?
   - Should it be shown as a multiplier (e.g., ""×10⁶"") or in scientific notation?
   - Should the offset be applied to all values or only when they exceed certain thresholds?

The expected format in the legend should include the offset value for clarity, such as displaying values like ""1.5M"" instead of ""1500000"" or using a multiplier like ""×10⁶"". Currently, the actual format in the legend omits this offset. This problem appears with specific plotting types like scatter plots created using `so.Plot` or `sns.scatterplot`.

2. The issue occurs with plots that utilize the `ScalarFormatter` for legends. I've encountered it specifically with `sns.scatterplot` and `so.Plot` but haven't tried all plot types. It's not tied to any specific style settings or themes from what I've tested.

3. The expected behavior for managing the offset is for it to be clearly indicated in the legend, such as using a multiplier ""×10⁶"" or formatted as ""1M"" for clarity. The offset should be presented clearly when values exceed a threshold that would otherwise make it challenging to read, such as in the case of millions or larger.","There is an issue with the formatting of legend values in plots when using large numerical ranges. Specifically, legends generated with `ScalarFormatter` do not include the necessary multiplicative offset, leading to incorrect representation of large numbers. This problem affects plots created with certain plotting functions and may be influenced by specific configuration settings. The root cause appears to be related to how the offset value is handled in the code."

2. Specific conditions or edge cases where this type coercion happens:

   - It happens when the object on the right-hand side of the assignment has a `values` property.
   - The issue is notably relevant when using object-type arrays containing instances with a `values` attribute, similar to ones like `lmfit.ModelResult`.

3. In the context of the `lmfit.ModelResult` example:

   - I don't have the detailed structure of a `ModelResult` object.

These points highlight the coercion issue, which primarily involves objects that have a `values` property but aren't intended to be coerced as array-like types.","The issue involves a type coercion problem in xarray when assigning objects with a `values` property to a DataArray. This behavior prevents storing certain objects in arrays with `dtype==object`, as the presence of a `values` property leads to unintended coercion.

However, with the `pydap` engine, the same variable gives values such as `128.0`, `255.0`, `0.0`, `1.0`, `2.0`, `nan`, `127.0`.

2. The specific OPeNDAP hack for storing signed bytes is adding an attribute `_Unsigned=False` to the variable. This is similar to adding `_Unsigned=True` in netCDF3 for unsigned bytes.

Are there any specific edge cases I should be aware of, such as:
   - Empty vocabulary
   - Vocabulary with special characters
   - Case sensitivity considerations

Please provide these details so I can implement a proper solution.","1. Sure, here's a code snippet demonstrating the issue:

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
corpus = [
    'This is the first document.',
    'This is the second second document.',
    'And the third one.',
    'Is this the first document?',
]

vocabulary = ['and', 'document', 'first', 'is', 'one', 'second', 'the', 'third', 'this']
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(vocabulary=vocabulary)

vectorizer.get_feature_names()  # Raises NotFittedError
```

2. When a vocabulary is provided but the vectorizer isn't fitted, `transform` calls `_validate_vocabulary`, which sets the `vocabulary_` instance variable, allowing the transformation to work without raising `NotFittedError`.

3. Regarding edge cases:
   - An empty vocabulary might cause issues since there's nothing to transform.
   - Vocabulary with special characters should be tested to ensure they are handled correctly.
   - Case sensitivity should also be considered, as it might affect how words are matched and transformed.","There is an issue with the `CountVectorizer` class in which the `get_feature_names` method raises a `NotFittedError` when a vocabulary is provided at initialization, but the vectorizer has not been explicitly fitted. The expectation is that providing a vocabulary should allow certain operations without fitting, similar to how the `transform` method behaves. The inconsistency between these methods is the core of the problem."

```
E       assert 0

```

3. The dynamic xfail marking was generally used to mark tests as expected to fail during test execution based on specific conditions or test parameters. It wasn't limited to any particular scenarios, and the example provided was typical of the usage.","In the transition from pytest version 5.x to 6.0.0rc0, a change in behavior was observed regarding the dynamic addition of xfail markers to tests.

However, in the newer version, this approach results in the test failing outright, rather than being marked as an expected failure."

The PR mentions ""wrappers for sklearn estimators"" - can you clarify if there are specific wrapper classes or patterns where this is most problematic?

Let me know the answers to these questions so I can better understand the issue and implement an appropriate solution.","1. The error manifests when trying to clone an estimator with a parameter that is a class type. Here's a minimal code snippet that triggers the error:

    ```

2. The issue commonly occurs when storage of wrapped estimators as their classes, rather than instances, is attempted within a wrapper that behaves like an estimator itself. It's not tied to specific sklearn estimators but more to the way they are intended to be used in this pattern.

3. The wrappers are intended to provide compatibility methods for sklearn estimators modified to accept classes instead of instances. The idea is to handle parameter changes on the wrapper itself rather than directly on the estimator. This is most problematic when the intent is to show clarity to the user that wrapped estimators are parameters in the form of classes and are constructed on demand.","The issue involves a failure in the `clone` function when handling parameters that are estimator types rather than instances. This is relevant for projects that use class types as parameters within wrappers for sklearn estimators. The problem arises because the current implementation expects instances, leading to errors when class types are used. A potential fix involves modifying the code to handle class types, but there is uncertainty about the broader impact of this change."

3. In SVG format, the links are formatted relatively to the file the SVG is embedded on, causing issues when the embedding file is not in the root directory. For example, the link might appear as `../MyClass.html`. In the default image format (like PNG), these relative path issues don't occur, as the generation method seems to handle paths more correctly or perhaps the links aren't embedded in the same way. I hope this helps clarify the differences!",There is an issue with SVG inheritance diagrams generated by the Sphinx extension where links within the diagrams lead to 404 errors if the diagrams are not located in the root directory. This problem does not occur when using the default image format. The issue seems to be related to how link paths are resolved in SVG files compared to other formats.

   - **Input Polynomial**: 
     ```python
     from sympy import *
     x = symbols(""x"")
     f = Poly(sympify(""-117968192370600*18**(1/3)/(217603955769048*(24201 + 253*sqrt(9165))**(1/3) + 2273005839412*sqrt(9165)*(24201 + 253*sqrt(9165))**(1/3)) - 15720318185*2**(2/3)*3**(1/3)*(24201 + 253*sqrt(9165))**(2/3)/(217603955769048*(24201 + 253*sqrt(9165))**(1/3) + 2273005839412*sqrt(9165)*(24201 + 253*sqrt(9165))**(1/3)) + 15720318185*12**(1/3)*(24201 + 253*sqrt(9165))**(2/3)/(217603955769048*(24201 + 253*sqrt(9165))**(1/3) + 2273005839412*sqrt(9165)*(24201 + 253*sqrt(9165))**(1/3)) + 117968192370600*2**(1/3)*3**(2/3)/(217603955769048*(24201 + 253*sqrt(9165))**(1/3) + 2273005839412*sqrt(9165)*(24201 + 253*sqrt(9165))**(1/3))""), x)
     coeff, bad_poly = f.clear_denoms()
     ```

   - **Expected Output**:
     `bad_poly` should clearly be `Poly(0, x, domain='EX')` and behave like a zero polynomial.

   - **Actual Output/Behavior**: 
     `bad_poly` appears as `Poly(0, x, domain='EX')` but doesn't act like a zero polynomial. For example, `bad_poly.is_zero` returns `False`.

   - **Error Messages/Unexpected Results**: 
     Methods like `terms_gcd()` and `primitive()` behave inconsistently or raise errors, e.g., an `IndexError` in `terms_gcd()`.

2. Unstripped Leading Zero:

   - **Internal Representation**: 
     The leading zeros appear in the list representation of the underlying `DMP` of the polynomial. It shows as `DMP([EX(0)], EX, None)` instead of `DMP([], EX, None)`.

   - **Specific Operations**: 
     This causes issues in operations like `terms_gcd()` and previously in `primitive()`, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

3. Scope:

   - **Specific Types**: 
     The issue was replicated with univariate polynomials with EX (Expression) domain coefficients.

   - **Coefficient Types**: 
     Occurs with EX coefficients. There aren't specific occurrences noted with other coefficient types yet.","There is an issue with the `clear_denoms()` function in a symbolic computation library where a polynomial that should be zero is not behaving as expected. The polynomial appears to be zero when printed, but its internal representation causes inconsistencies in behavior, such as incorrect evaluations and errors in certain operations.

Since this is related to `Basic` class behavior, what specific `Basic` class invariance properties should the `String` class maintain? Are there any specific comparison or hash-related behaviors that need to be preserved?

2. The `String` class should maintain the invariance property that `Basic` classes have, meaning `expr.func(*expr.args) == expr` should always hold true. Additionally, the object should properly implement equality and hashing (`__eq__`, `__hash__`) behavior consistent with `Basic`.

3. I haven't encountered specific edge cases or problematic string comparisons beyond this argument invariance issue.
