Once I have this information, I can proceed with exploring the repository, reproducing the error, and implementing the necessary changes.","1. The issue with aberration handling is related to the apparent inaccuracies when transforming from ITRS to AltAz due to differences between geocentric and topocentric aberration. The desired behavior is to have more direct and accurate transformations that account for these differences.

2. The current implementation can transform ITRS positions based on different `obstimes`, but this leads to them being treated relative to the SSB, which isn't ideal for stationary Earth objects. The proposed change is to keep ITRS positions constant over time in these specific transformations, treating them as time-invariant.

3. Currently, the transformation logic involves an intermediate step that isn't straightforward for users interested in observed frames for satellite observations. The transformation from ITRS to observed frames can result in unexpected results, partly due to the time-varying nature of current ITRS implementation coupled with aberration issues.

4. A scenario demonstrating this issue involves the inaccurate transformation of coordinates when using ITRS values of a satellite to transform to AltAz. The test case in `test_intermediate_transformations.test_straight_overhead()` showcases such inaccuracies.

5. I don't have specific details on edge cases like extreme altitudes or high velocities, but the general idea is that the solution should be robust to typical satellite observation scenarios.","The issue discusses a new approach for transforming coordinates between the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) and observed frames like AltAz and HADec. The current method has been problematic for users observing objects like satellites due to inaccuracies related to geocentric versus topocentric aberration.

2. The issue with the current validation logic is that it accepts URLs with these characters in the username and password fields without them being %-encoded. This originates from the implementation based on Diego Perini's gist, which was used in the changeset #20003. The `URLValidator` in `django/core/validators.py` is responsible for this validation, and it requires modification to the regex to reject such invalid characters.

3. An example of a URL that is currently passing validation but should not is `http://foo/bar@example.com`. Additionally, adding a query string like `?m=foo@example.com` to many URLs listed in `tests/validators/invalid_urls.txt` makes them pass validation incorrectly.

There is no specific mention of `TIME_ZONE` settings for SQLite or Oracle in the issue.

2. **Expected Behavior**: The expected behavior is that when filtering datetime fields, Django should use the `TIME_ZONE` setting to properly convert times. This means converting from the database timezone (`tz2`) to the Django application timezone (`tz1`), or skipping conversion if they are the same.

3. **Current Behavior**: Currently, when filtering using date lookups, Django incorrectly uses `CONVERT_TZ` from 'UTC' to `tz1`, regardless of the database setting.

4. **Database Support for Time Zones**: MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle do not support time zones natively in Django. This affects conversion logic because without timezone support, manual conversion needs to be implemented.

5. **Edge Cases**: An edge case is when the application and database time zones are the same (`tz1` == `tz2`). In such cases, there should be no need for conversion, and this should work without needing timezone tables filled in MySQL.","There is an issue with Django's handling of time zones in database queries when using MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle.

Once I have this information, I can proceed with exploring the repository and creating a script to reproduce the error.","1. Users with ""view"" permissions are supposed to be able to only view entries in the admin interface without making any changes. However, with this issue, they can add or remove items in the ManyToManyField inline, which they shouldn't be able to do.

3. I noticed the issue in version 2.1.7. It seems there was a regression or a bug with the new view permissions feature introduced around this version.

4. The unauthorized modifications happen through the admin interface. Users with view-only permissions can adjust the ManyToManyField inline by adding or removing `Photo` instances from a `Report`.

5.

**Are there any existing tests or examples that demonstrate the correct behavior when using `HttpResponse` with `bytes` or `str` content?** This could help in understanding the expected behavior and in creating a test case for the `memoryview` scenario.

**Is there any documentation or guidelines on how Django should handle `memoryview` objects in `HttpResponse`?** This could provide insights into the intended design and any potential edge cases.

Please provide answers to these questions so I can proceed with the next steps.","1. The expected behavior when using a `memoryview` object with `HttpResponse` is for it to output the actual byte content, similar to how it handles `str` or `bytes` content. So, if the content is set with a `memoryview(b""My Content"")`, the expected output should be `b'My Content'`.

2. It's suspected that the issue involves the `HttpResponseBase.make_bytes` method. This method could potentially be adapted to handle `memoryview` objects by casting them to bytes.

3. I don't have specific information on existing tests, but HttpResponse with `bytes` and `str` content should correctly output the content in byte form, which is the expected standard behavior and can guide in creating a test case for `memoryview`.","The issue involves a compatibility problem when using Django's HttpResponse with memoryview objects.

2. **PostgreSQL Configuration**: The PostgreSQL server configuration can vary. In typical setups that require mutual TLS, connections need the client certificate and key. The `dbshell` could determine usage based on the presence of these parameters in the settings.

3. **Existing Configuration**: Yes, Django already supports mutual TLS for database connections through the `OPTIONS` in the database settings, but currently, the `dbshell` doesn't support using client certificate parameters.

The current migration file discovery uses `pkgutil.iter_modules()` which relies on the package's `__path__`, suitable for Python 3 namespace packages. This should remain the same post-change. The process doesn't need a `__file__` check anymore.

2. The check for the `__file__` attribute happens in the `django/db/migrations/loader.py` file. This check is redundant because file discovery now uses `pkgutil.iter_modules()` which does not require `__file__`, as it works with the package's `__path__`.

**Example Usage**: Can you provide an example of how the `call_command` function is being called with keyword arguments that leads to the error? This will help in creating a reproducible script.

**Current Implementation**: Are there any specific parts of the current implementation of the `call_command` function that you suspect might be causing the issue? For example, is there a particular method or logic that handles argument parsing?

**Expected Behavior**: What is the expected behavior when the `call_command` function is called with keyword arguments for a command that includes a required mutually exclusive argument group?

Once I have this information, I can proceed to explore the repository, create a script to reproduce the error, and implement the necessary changes to resolve the issue.","1. The mutually exclusive argument group causing the issue includes `--shop-id` and `--shop`. They are defined as mutually exclusive within a required group, meaning one of them must be provided, but not both. Currently, when using `call_command`, only one of them is intended to be specified in the keyword arguments.

2. The exact error message is: `django.core.management.base.CommandError: Error: one of the arguments --shop-id --shop is required`. This occurs when I run `call_command('my_command', shop_id=1)`.

3. An example of how `call_command` is being called that leads to the error is: `call_command('my_command', shop_id=1)`. However, it works when called like this: `call_command('my_command', '--shop-id=1')`.

4. The part of the current implementation that I suspect might be causing the issue is the logic that handles which keyword arguments are passed to the parser. As described, it seems only required arguments are passed, but it does not account for the mutually exclusive group requirement.

5. The expected behavior when `call_command` is called with keyword arguments for a command that includes a required mutually exclusive group is that it should correctly recognize the provided argument as satisfying the requirement, without throwing an error. In this case, providing `shop_id=1` in keyword arguments should work similarly to passing `--shop-id=1` as a positional argument.","The issue involves a failure in the `call_command` function when using keyword arguments for a command that includes a required mutually exclusive argument group. The error occurs because the function does not handle mutually exclusive groups correctly, leading to a command error when arguments are passed as keyword arguments.

2. When the username is `None`, the current behavior is that `ModelBackend.authenticate()` proceeds to make a database query and runs the password hasher, even though this is redundant in such cases.

3. The expected behavior when either the username or password is `None` is for the method to return immediately, avoiding unnecessary database queries and password hasher execution.

4. `ModelBackend.authenticate()` can operate alongside other authentication backends. It should avoid unnecessary operations when credentials might be intended for another backend, preventing redundant processing.

5. I haven't identified specific edge cases related to empty strings versus `None` for username or password. The main concern is efficiently skipping unnecessary processing when the credentials are clearly absent.","The issue highlights an inefficiency in the `ModelBackend.authenticate()` method, where a database query is unnecessarily executed when the username is `None`.

2. An example of a delete operation affected by this issue is `Model.objects.all().delete()`.

3. This issue is particularly pronounced with MySQL/MariaDB databases.

4. In Django 3.0, the expected SQL query is `DELETE FROM table_name`. In Django 3.1, it is `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM table_name)`.

5. The issue involves any model using the Django ORM where `delete()` is called on a queryset, leading to the described subquery.

6. Benchmark tests involve deleting 100k rows from a table and show a significant increase in execution time from 0.2 seconds to 7.5 seconds when comparing the old and new queries.","There is a performance regression issue related to the use of subqueries in delete operations with Django 3.1, which affects the ability to use table locks effectively.

**Assignment Order**: When you assign the child object to the parent, is the child object's primary key already set, or is it set after the assignment?

**Error Details**: Can you provide the exact error message or traceback that occurs when the transaction fails due to the foreign key violation?

**Current Behavior**: What is the current behavior when the child object's primary key is not set before assignment? Does it raise an error immediately, or does it fail during the save operation?

**Expected Behavior**: What is the expected behavior when the child object's primary key is not set before assignment? Should the parent's foreign key field be updated after the child's primary key is set, or should it handle the assignment differently?

**Repository Structure**: Is there a specific file or module in the repository where the foreign key relationship is defined? If so, can you provide the path to that file?

Once I have this information, I can proceed to explore the repository and create a script to reproduce the error.","1. The parent object, `Product`, has a primary key of type `CharField`. The child object, `Order`, references this `Product` with a foreign key.

2. In the first scenario, the child object's primary key (`sku` for `Product`) is set after the assignment to the parent (`Order`).

3. The transaction fails on commit with a `ForeignKeyViolation` due to the non-existence of a product with an empty string as its primary key.

4. If the child's primary key is not set before assignment, it does not raise an error immediately. The foreign key in the parent is set to an empty string, leading to a failure during the save operation when the transaction is committed.

5. The expected behavior is for the parent's foreign key field to be updated with the child's primary key once it is set, even if the primary key was not initially set before assignment.

6. The relevant foreign key relationship and behavior would typically be handled in `django/db/models/base.py`.","The issue involves data loss when saving a parent object that has a foreign key relationship with a child object, particularly when the child object has a non-numeric primary key. When the child object is assigned to the parent before its primary key is set, the parent's foreign key field does not update correctly, leading to a failed transaction due to a foreign key violation.

2. The specific error message is `TypeError: object HttpResponse can't be used in 'await' expression`.

3. There aren't specific ASGI settings in the project related to this issue. The problem is related to the middleware not supporting async in an ASGI context.

4. I find that the middleware documentation could be clearer on whether all middleware should support async when used in ASGI apps. It currently implies that using `async_capable = False` should be sufficient, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

5. The expected behavior is that the middleware should only be applied to synchronous requests, and the application should not raise errors or fail when running in an ASGI context.","The issue involves unexpected side effects when using middleware in an ASGI context with Django, particularly when certain middleware is not used as expected. This results in errors related to asynchronous processing, which complicates debugging and affects the application's error handling.

[value] is not one of the available choices,"" where [value] is the invalid choice.

2. The invalid choice value is typically a string, as it represents the input that does not match any available options.

3. The expected format for the error message, when including the invalid choice, should resemble: ""Select a valid choice. [value] is not one of the available choices,"" where [value] should be the specific invalid value provided.

**Expected Behavior**: What is the expected behavior when the `__file__` attribute is missing? Should Django fall back to a different method to locate migrations, or should it raise an error?

**Current Behavior**: What is the current behavior of Django when the `__file__` attribute is missing? Does it raise an error, or does it silently fail?

**Relevant Code Sections**: Are there any specific sections of the Django codebase that are known to be problematic or that you suspect need modification?

**Edge Cases**: Are there any specific edge cases you are aware of that we should consider when implementing the fix?

Once I have this information, I can proceed to explore the repository and start working on the solution.","1. The `__file__` attribute is missing in frozen Python environments, such as those that do not set `__file__` by default for regular packages. I'm not referring to specific Python distributions but more to environments where Python code is embedded or packaged differently.

2. In such cases, Django should be able to find existing migrations without relying on the `__file__` attribute. It shouldn't raise an error due to the absence of `__file__`.

3. Currently, Django skips searching for migrations if the `__file__` attribute is missing, effectively not recognizing the migrations in these environments.

4. The problematic section is in `django/db/migrations/loader.py`, specifically in the `MigrationLoader.load_disk` method that checks `getattr(m, '__file__', None)`.

**What are the potential consequences of this issue, other than incorrect statistics and inefficiencies?**
**Are there any specific files or directories in the repository that are more likely to be affected by this issue?**

Please provide answers to these questions so I can proceed with the next steps.","1. The expected behavior of the `post_process()` method in the `HashedFilesMixin` class is to yield each file once after it has been processed, so collectstatic's collect can accurately track the number of files post-processed.

2. When using Django 1.11.5 with the contrib.admin app enabled and running `./manage.py collectstatic --noinput`, the same original filename is yielded multiple times, resulting in duplicate entries such as:

   - Post-processed 'admin/css/base.css' as 'admin/css/base.6b517d0d5813.css'

3. The issue occurs during the `post_process()` method's multiple passes over found files to handle nested references, causing it to yield the same file multiple times unintentionally, even for assets not needing adjustment in the second pass.

4. Beyond incorrect statistics and inefficiencies, the issue might lead to increased deploy times, especially for scenarios involving expensive operations like Brotli compression or when using S3 backends, which might upload the same file multiple times.

2. **Current Implementation Details**: In the current implementation, `CharField.__init__` automatically appends a `MaxLengthValidator` regardless of whether `max_length` is `None`. This means the validator is added every time `CharField` is instantiated, even when it's not needed.

3. **Error Scenario**: An error occurs when a `CharField` is instantiated with `max_length` as `None`, which results in a `MaxLengthValidator` that attempts to compare an integer with `None`, leading to a `TypeError` during validation.

4. **Proposed Solution Details**: The proposed solution modifies `CharField.__init__` to append the `MaxLengthValidator` only if `self.max_length` is not `None`, similar to the logic already used in `BinaryField.__init__`.

5. **Testing Details**: The change was tested locally by ensuring all existing Django tests passed, and a new test case was added to verify that the error does not occur when `max_length` is `None`.

**Expected Behavior**: What is the expected behavior when a custom ""empty_label"" is set for a foreign key field and radio fields are defined? Should the custom label always be respected, or are there specific conditions under which it should be overridden?

**Reproduction Steps**: Could you provide a minimal example or steps to reproduce the issue? This will help in creating a script to reproduce the error and confirm the fix.

Once I have these details, I can proceed with exploring the repository, creating a script to reproduce the error, and making the necessary changes to resolve the issue.","1. The `ModelAdmin` class and the `formfield_for_foreignkey` method are part of the Django admin framework and can typically be found in the Django source code. For this issue specifically, the relevant code is in the `django/contrib/admin/options.py` file, around line 234.

2. Currently, when you use `ModelAdmin` with defined `radio_fields`, the custom ""empty_label"" that is set in the `formfield_for_foreignkey` method is overridden by the default `_('None')` label.

3. The expected behavior is that when a custom ""empty_label"" is set through `kwargs` in the `formfield_for_foreignkey` method, it should take precedence over the default `_('None')` label, even when `radio_fields` are defined.

4. I don't have a specific minimal example, but to reproduce the issue, you can create a `ModelAdmin` subclass where you define `radio_fields` and attempt to set a custom ""empty_label"" in the `formfield_for_foreignkey` method. You’ll notice that the custom label does not appear, and the default label is used instead.","There is an issue with the ModelAdmin class in Django where a custom ""empty_label"" set for a foreign key field is being overridden by a default value when radio fields are defined.

Please provide answers to these questions so I can proceed with the next steps.","1. **Data Range and Axes Limits**: The data range is between 10 and 20. Before the issue occurs, the axes limits are expected to be (10, 20) with some margins. After creating a SpanSelector with `interactive=True`, the x-axis limits incorrectly expand to include 0 instead of remaining around 10 to 20.

2. **SpanSelector Behavior**: In the current development version, setting the SpanSelector to interactive mode causes the axes limits to expand to include 0, even though no interaction with the selector has occurred. In previous versions (e.g., Matplotlib 3.4), with `span_stays`, this behavior was not present, and the limits would remain as expected.

3. **Margins**: The specific margins aren't detailed in the issue, but normally, they would be Matplotlib's default auto margins. These margins are typically configurable in Matplotlib.

4. **Interactive Mode**: Yes, the issue seems specific to when `interactive=True` is set for the SpanSelector. It wasn't described whether similar problems occur in non-interactive mode.

**Existing Auto-Detection**: You mentioned that the library already has functionality to auto-detect data types for other functions. Can you provide an example of such a function and how it auto-detects data types? This will help in understanding the pattern to follow.

**Edge Cases**: Are there any specific edge cases you have in mind that the solution should handle? For example, how should the function behave if the boolean array contains only `True` values or only `False` values?

Once I have this information, I can proceed with exploring the repository and implementing the necessary changes.","1. **Boolean Array Handling**: Currently, when a boolean array is passed to the `contour()` function, it defaults to 8 levels, which are spaced between 0 and 1. This results in all contour lines being drawn on top of each other, which is not useful for boolean arrays.

2. **Default Contour Level**: The default contour level for boolean arrays should be [0.5]. This effectively draws the boundary line between `True` and `False` regions.

3. **Existing Auto-Detection**: An example of existing auto-detection in the library is with `imshow()`, which automatically differentiates between 0-1 float RGBA arrays and 0-255 uint8 RGBA arrays when given a 3D array as input.

4. **Edge Cases**: I don't have specific edge cases in mind, but the function should ideally handle arrays that contain only `True` values or only `False` values in a sensible manner.","The issue discusses the inconvenience of manually setting contour levels when using boolean arrays with the `contour()` function.

**Can you provide an example of how the alignment options are being used and how they are expected to behave?**

Please provide this information so I can proceed with the next steps.","1. **HPacker Component:** `HPacker` is part of the `matplotlib.offsetbox` module. It is used for horizontal packing of child artists, such as other offset boxes, into a single offset box.

2. **Expected Alignment Options and Current Functionality:** The expected alignment options for `HPacker` are ""top"" and ""bottom"". Currently, these options are functioning in reverse, meaning that using ""top"" aligns the content to the bottom and using ""bottom"" aligns it to the top.

3. **Example Usage and Expected Behavior:**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.offsetbox import DrawingArea, HPacker, VPacker, AnchoredOffsetbox, TextArea
from matplotlib.patches import Rectangle

da1 = DrawingArea(10, 20)
rect1 = Rectangle((0, 0), 10, 20)

Please provide answers to these questions so I can proceed with the necessary changes to the repository.","1. The specific overflow error is an `OverflowError: signed integer is greater than maximum`. It occurs because the DPI value keeps doubling until it exceeds the maximum integer limit during the unpickling process.

2. The steps to reproduce the issue on an M1 Mac system using the MacOSX backend are:
   - Run the provided Python code snippet on an M1 Mac with MacOSX backend enabled in Matplotlib.
   - The script will double the figure's DPI each time it is unpickled, leading to an overflow error after many iterations.

3. This issue involves the `__setstate__` method in `matplotlib.figure.Figure` and functions related to the backend, such as `new_figure_manager_given_figure` and `FigureCanvas` in `backend_macosx.py`.

Please provide answers to these questions so I can proceed with the necessary changes.","1. When creating a new colormap, you can assign it a name (e.g., `some_cmap_name`). Then, when you register this colormap with a different name (e.g., `my_cmap_name`), the internal name of the colormap (the one it's created with) and the registered name (the one used to refer to it later) differ. This difference seems to cause issues when trying to use the colormap by its registered name.

2. When using the `pyplot` interface, if you try to set or refer to a colormap by its registered name and the internal colormap object has a different name, it results in an error. Specifically, `plt.imshow()` tries to look up the colormap by its internal name rather than the registered name, leading to a `ValueError`.

3. The expected behavior is that after registering a colormap under a specific name, it should be retrievable and usable by that name through the `pyplot` interface without error, regardless of the colormap's internal name.

So, for `mincnt=1`, it should plot hexagons for all bins containing at least one data point.

2. **Behavior Description with `C`**: When `C` is specified, the expected behavior of `mincnt` should be the same: hexagons should be plotted for bins containing at least `mincnt` number of data points. However, the behavior currently seems to require at least `mincnt + 1` data points for these bins to be plotted when `C` is given.

3. **Current Behavior**: Currently, without `C`, `mincnt=1` behaves as expected by plotting bins with one or more points. With `C` specified, `mincnt=1` currently results in plotting only those bins with at least two points, which is unexpected.

Please provide answers to these questions so I can proceed with the next steps.","1. The specific data used is stored in a file named `test.npy`, which is part of a GitHub repository I started for testing this issue. For parameters, an example where the issue can be reproduced is with `bins=100`, `density=True`, and `histtype='step'`.

2. The expected behavior when using `histtype='step'` and `density=True` is that the density axis should automatically scale to fit the entire histogram, similar to how it behaves with other `histtype` options like `'bar'`.

3. The current behavior causing the issue is that when using `histtype='step'` and setting `density=True`, the density axis does not automatically scale to fit the entire histogram data. Instead, it becomes dependent on the scale of the input data.

4. The rescaling mentioned refers to changes in the amplitude of the input data (like multiplying the data with a factor), which should affect only the x-axis values (the bin edges), but it inconsistently affects the density axis when using `histtype='step'`.","There is an issue with the `matplotlib.axes.Axes.hist` function where the density axis is not automatically adjusted when using `histtype='step'` and `density=True`. This results in inconsistent scaling of the density axis compared to other histogram types, particularly when the data is rescaled. The problem does not occur with other `histtype` options, and the behavior is unexpected as rescaling should only affect the x-axis. The issue is reproducible with specific data and parameters.",4.0

**Additional Context**: Are there any other details or context about the issue that would be helpful for me to know?

Please provide answers to these questions so I can proceed with the next steps.","1. **Engine Differences**: netCDF3 only supports signed bytes and uses a convention of adding an attribute `_Unsigned=True` for handling unsigned bytes. OPeNDAP, on the other hand, natively supports unsigned bytes and uses a hack, by adding an attribute `_Unsigned=False`, to handle signed bytes. This hack is handled by the netCDF-c library but not by pydap.

2. **Current Behavior**: When using the `pydap` engine, xarray doesn't correctly recognize the signed byte hack and interprets the data incorrectly, resulting in values like 128.0 and 255.0 instead of negative values as with `netcdf4`.

3. **Expected Behavior**: The expected behavior is for xarray to correctly recognize and handle the `_Unsigned=False` attribute when using the `pydap` engine, ensuring consistent interpretation of signed bytes, similar to the `netcdf4` engine.

4. **Specific Files**: The issue might be related to the file `xarray/coding/variables.py`, particularly where xarray interprets the `_Unsigned` attribute for variables.

5. **Additional Context**: The discrepancy is linked to how pydap does not internally handle the signed byte hack as netCDF-c does. If needed, I can help prepare a PR for this fix.","The issue involves discrepancies in handling signed and unsigned bytes when using different engines to read datasets from OPeNDAP via pydap. While netCDF3 and OPeNDAP have different conventions for handling byte data, a specific hack allows for the storage of signed bytes in OPeNDAP.

The expected behavior of the `.swap_dims()` function is to return a new dataset object that is a copy of the original with the dimensions swapped. It should not modify the original dataset in place.

Please provide answers to these questions so I can proceed with the next steps.","1. The error is occurring during operations that involve setting and resetting indexes, specifically when calling `set_index` followed by `reset_index` with the `drop=True` parameter. The problem arises because the logic incorrectly assumes that coordinate names should not exceed the number of variables, which is no longer a valid assumption after the index refactor.

   - All attributes set on the original DataArray should be preserved in the result. There isn't a need to ignore or overwrite specific attributes.
   - Attributes should be preserved whether they are explicitly set or default values. The focus is on maintaining consistency in attributes between the input and output.

2. **Data Type Conservation**:
   - Ideally, the output data type should match the input data type unless the operations performed inherently require a change (e.g., operations that promote types in the context of NumPy). There aren't explicit conditions mentioned that require a change, but understanding promotion rules can help.
   - No specific exceptions were raised; it’s more about maintaining type when feasible.

    Out[4]: 
    <xarray.Dataset>
    Dimensions:  (time: 24)
    Coordinates:
        day      (time) int64 0 365 730 1095 1460 1825 ... 6935 7300 7665 8030 8395
    Dimensions without coordinates: time
    Data variables:
        T        (time) int64 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23

    In [5]: ds.coarsen(time=12).construct(time=(""year"", ""month""))

    ```

2. The specific non-dimensional coordinate being converted into a variable is `day`.

3. The behavior is triggered by the `ds.coarsen(time=12).construct(time=(""year"", ""month""))` method, where the time dimension is being coarsened and then constructed into new dimensions ""year"" and ""month"".

4. The expected output is that the `day` coordinate remains as a coordinate after the `ds.Coarsen.construct` operation, rather than being converted into a variable.","The issue involves the `ds.Coarsen.construct` method in a data processing library, where non-dimensional coordinates are unexpectedly converted into variables during the operation.

During manual iteration, despite setting `center=True`, the windows are not centered, which is the unexpected behavior.

This means that if the test indeed failed, it would be marked as ""XFAIL"" in the test results, indicating that the failure was expected and thus not causing the overall test suite to fail.

3. In pytest version 6.0.0rc0, when an xfail marker is dynamically added, the current behavior is that the test fails outright, raising an `AssertionError`, rather than being marked as expected to fail. This differs from the expected behavior in version 5.x, where it would be treated as an expected failure.

4. I don't have that information.

5. I don't have that information.","In the transition from pytest version 5.x to 6.0.0rc0, a change in behavior was observed regarding the dynamic addition of xfail markers to tests.

For example, in `test_chained_exception_with_from`, the trace includes exceptions 11, 12, and 13. With `xdist`, only the final exception, 13, is displayed.

2. **Test Execution Context**: The discrepancy appears in tests that involve chained exceptions, specifically when using the `from` keyword for exception chaining. No particular test configurations beyond this are mentioned as exacerbating the issue.

3. **Current Behavior**: There are no additional logs or outputs indicating why only the final exception is displayed with `xdist`. No warnings or errors from `xdist` provide further insight.

   - Is there a specific module or class in the pytest codebase that manages the resolution of markers?

Please provide answers to these questions so I can proceed with the implementation.","1. **Issue Details**:
   - The issue occurs when using pytest markers in two base classes, `Foo` and `Bar`. If both are inherited, the markers from one of those classes are lost. Here's the code snippet demonstrating the issue:
     ```python
     import pytest

     class Foo:
         @pytest.mark.foo
         def method(self):
             pass

             pass
     ```
   - All types of markers can be affected by this issue.
   - I don't have specific information about the exact method in the pytest codebase that handles marker resolution.

2. **Metaclass Workaround**:
   - The metaclass workaround involves merging marker values by iteratively gathering them using the method resolution order (MRO) and is demonstrated in the provided code. The metaclass gathers marker information from the entire MRO for classes inheriting from multiple parents.
   - The workaround needs to adjust for Python 2 and 3 differences in metaclass declaration.

3. **Behavior Expectations**:
   - The expected behavior is that markers from multiple base classes should be combined and retained for the derived class. They should not override each other but be merged.
   - There are no specific scenarios mentioned where the current behavior is intentionally acceptable. 

4. **Repository Structure**:
   - I don't have specific information about the relevant directories or files in the repository for handling pytest markers.

Now, they are generated without the underscore and are visible by default in the fixture list.

2. **Fixture Documentation**: The fixtures should start with an underscore to indicate they are private and not displayed in the default fixture list unless verbosity is increased with the `-v` flag. This helps maintain documentation standards by not cluttering the output with internal, undocumented fixtures.

3. **CI Script Enforcement**: The CI script enforces that all public pytest fixtures must have accompanying documentation.

Please provide answers to these questions so I can proceed with the next steps.","1. The specific error message is: 
   ```
   ValueError: bins must be monotonically increasing or decreasing

2. The error occurs when `n_bins` in the `KBinsDiscretizer` is set to a high value relative to the data points, such as 5 bins for the array `[0, 0.5, 2, 3, 9, 10]`. It can also happen with a reasonable number of bins proportional to the order of `log_2(number of unique values of X)`.

3. The issue arises because the centers, and consequently the `bin_edges`, can be unsorted when using the 'kmeans' strategy, causing problems with `np.digitize`, which requires monotonically increasing or decreasing bins.","The issue involves a failure in the `KBinsDiscretizer` when using the 'kmeans' strategy, which occurs due to unsorted bin edges. This unsorted nature leads to an error during the binning process, particularly affecting the `np.digitize` function. The problem can be reproduced by increasing the number of bins in a test case, which highlights the edge case where the number of bins approaches the number of data points. The expected behavior is for the process to complete without errors, but currently, a `ValueError` is raised due to the requirement for bins to be sorted.",4.0

**Expected Behavior**: What is the expected behavior when `copy_X` is set to `False` during initialization? Should it remain `False` throughout the fitting process, or should it revert to the default value in the `fit` method if not explicitly provided?

**Edge Cases**: Are there any specific edge cases or scenarios where the conflicting values for `copy_X` are more likely to occur? For example, does this issue arise more frequently with certain types of data or specific usage patterns?

Once I have this information, I can proceed to explore the repository and implement the necessary changes.","1. The conflicting values for `copy_X` occur because the `LassoLarsIC` class has a `copy_X` parameter both in its initialization and in the `fit` method. If you set `copy_X` to `False` during initialization, like `my_lasso = LassoLarsIC(copy_X=False)`, and then call `my_lasso.fit(X, y)`, the `copy_X=True` in the `fit` method will overwrite your initial setting since it has a default value of `True`.

2. The expected behavior when `copy_X` is set to `False` during initialization is that it should ideally remain `False` throughout the fitting process unless the user explicitly provides a different value when calling `fit`.

3. I haven't identified specific edge cases, but the issue is particularly problematic because the overwriting happens silently when a user doesn't specify `copy_X` in the `fit` method, especially if they expect their initial setting to persist. This can occur with any type of data or usage pattern where the assumption is that the initialization parameter will control the behavior.","There is an issue with the `LassoLarsIC` class in the handling of the `copy_X` parameter, where it is defined both in the class initialization and the `fit` method, potentially leading to conflicting values. This can result in unexpected behavior, particularly when the user sets `copy_X` to `False` during initialization, as it may be overwritten by the default value in `fit`. A proposed solution involves modifying the `fit` method to only change the `copy_X` value if explicitly provided by the user, to avoid breaking existing code.",3.0

Please provide answers to these questions so I can proceed with the necessary changes.","1. The expected behavior when `n_init` is set to a value greater than 1 in the `GaussianMixture` class is that both the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods should return consistent and identical results after fitting the model.

2. The current behavior that leads to the discrepancy is that `fit_predict` returns the clustering from the last of the `n_init` initializations, while `predict` uses the best fit found over all `n_init` initializations. This inconsistency arises because `fit_predict` does not restore the best solution before predicting.

3. The issue occurs for all values of `n_init` greater than 1.

The expectation is that with `'multinomial'`, it uses the softmax function for prediction, but it's currently using a one-vs-rest approach with a single logistic function.

2. **Logistic Regression Instance**: The specific logistic regression instance is in the helper function `_log_reg_scoring_path()`, where an instance of `LogisticRegression` is initialized without inheriting the `multi_class` parameter from `LogisticRegressionCV`.

3. **Scope of Changes**: The change needs to be made in the `sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py` file, particularly in the `_log_reg_scoring_path()` function.

scikit-learn__scikit-learn-9288,"**Inconsistency Details**: Can you provide more details on the specific parameters or conditions under which the KMeans clustering algorithm produces inconsistent results? For example, what are the typical values for the number of clusters, the number of samples, and the number of features?

**Parallelism Levels**: When you mention different levels of parallelism, what are the specific values for the `n_jobs` parameter that you are comparing? Are there any other parameters that might affect the results, such as the initialization method (`init`), the number of iterations (`max_iter`), or the tolerance (`tol`)?

**Inconsistent Output**: What specific outputs are inconsistent? Is it the cluster assignments, the inertia values, or both? Can you provide examples of the inconsistent outputs for both single-threaded and multi-threaded executions?

**Environment Details**: Are there any specific versions of Python, NumPy, or other dependencies that might be relevant to this issue? Also, are there any specific hardware configurations (e.g., CPU cores, memory) that might affect the results?

**Reproducibility**: Is the inconsistency reproducible across multiple runs, or does it only occur occasionally? If it is reproducible, can you provide a minimal example or a set of data that consistently reproduces the issue?

Once I have these details, I can proceed with exploring the repository, creating a script to reproduce the error, and making the necessary changes to resolve the issue.","1. **Inconsistency Details**: The inconsistency occurs when running the `KMeans` clustering with the same data but varying the `n_jobs` parameter. The inconsistency appears despite the use of `random_state` to ensure reproducibility. The data used had 10,000 samples, 10 clusters, and 2 features.

2. **Parallelism Levels**: I compared `n_jobs=1` with `n_jobs=2`, `n_jobs=3`, and `n_jobs=4`. The issue is specifically with the `n_jobs` parameter. Other parameters like `init`, `max_iter`, and `tol` weren't mentioned as having an effect on this inconsistency.

3. **Inconsistent Output**: The specific output that was inconsistent is the inertia value. For example, with `n_jobs=1`, the inertia was 17815.004991244623, while for `n_jobs=2`, `n_jobs=3`, and `n_jobs=4`, the inertia was 17815.060435554242.

**Additional Context**: Are there any additional details or context about the issue that might be helpful, such as specific configurations or settings that affect the behavior of the autodoc feature?

Once I have this information, I can proceed with exploring the repository, creating a script to reproduce the error, and making the necessary changes to resolve the issue.","1. We use SWIG to wrap C++ classes for Python that include overloaded methods. For example, in the C++ code, we might have a method like `getFeatures` with multiple signatures, such as `int getFeatures(int type)`, `int getFeatures(int type, bool detailed)`, etc.

2. Currently, the autodoc feature in Sphinx only picks up the first method signature from the docstring and ignores the others. There's no error message, but it results in incomplete documentation, only displaying the first signature.

3. The expected behavior is for the autodoc feature to recognize and document all overloaded method signatures, not just the first one. We'd like all signatures to be listed clearly in the documentation.

4. I don't have specific files or directories to point out besides the general location of `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`, since that is the part of Sphinx responsible for handling the autodoc feature.

5. We use Sphinx to document Python bindings of a C++ API.

   From the file served at `http://localhost:63342/sphix_svg_bug/docs_build/my_package/index.html`, the SVG contains links like `../my_class_1.html#my_package.MyClass1` which Firefox expands to `http://localhost:63342/sphix_svg_bug/docs_build/my_class_1.html#my_package.MyClass1`, leading to a 404 page.

This occurs when using autodoc via apidoc, leading to unrelated variables being linked in the generated documentation. The problem is exacerbated when variables share names across different classes or subpackages, causing confusion in the documentation.

The issue is that autodoc, when searching for docstrings, uses the (namespace, attrname) key but does not check for baseclass-namespace. It seems to only search in the immediate class's namespace instead of inherited ones.

2. There aren't specific error messages, but the behavior observed is that inherited attributes (data members) aren't being documented even when the `:inherited-members:` option is used. 

3. The problem occurs with inherited attributes in general. There isn't a specific inheritance pattern highlighted, but examples given point to straightforward inheritance, like a subclass inheriting directly from a base class.

4. Currently, autodoc is believed to search for docstrings by inspecting code without instantiating classes, using functions like `find_attr_doc`. This method appears not to consider parent class modules' namespaces when looking for attributes' docs.

5. The expected behavior is that autodoc should document inherited attributes automatically when the `:inherited-members:` option is used, just as it does for inherited methods.",There is a problem with the autodoc feature where it fails to document inherited attributes from base classes.

There isn't a specific list of websites, but these sites seem to behave differently when HEAD requests are made.

2. The specific tool responsible for checking links is within the `sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py` file. It's part of the Sphinx repository, so it's not a third-party library but rather a built-in part of Sphinx for link checking.

3. Currently, when the 'Too Many Redirects' error occurs, the linkchecker reports the link as broken without attempting fallback mechanisms. The error bypasses any existing fallback logic because it specifically handles exceptions other than `TooManyRedirects`.

4. The current fallback logic retries with a GET request when specific exceptions are caught. The proposed change is to extend this logic so that it also retries with a GET request when a `TooManyRedirects` error occurs.

5. There are no specific edge cases mentioned, but the change should likely ensure that it doesn't introduce new issues for URLs that are valid with HEAD requests.

   These warnings refer to the unqualified type names `A`.

2. **Implicit Cross-References**: The `:type:` and `:rtype:` fields are used to annotate the parameter types and the return type of functions. They automatically create cross-references to the given types, and the issue is that for unqualified names, the lookup seems to search across all (sub)modules rather than following the module hierarchy.

3. **Hierarchical Module Structure**: There is a hierarchical module structure like this:
   - `mod` module, which contains:
     - Class `A`.
     - `submod` submodule, which contains:
       - Class `A`.

4. **Expected Behavior**: When resolving types, in the context of `mod.submod`, unqualified references to `A` should resolve to `mod.submod.A`, not `mod.A`. Similarly, within `mod`, an unqualified reference to `A` should resolve to `mod.A`.

5. **Hidden Details**: I don't know of any other hidden details or constraints beyond what's mentioned in the issue description.","The issue involves ambiguous class lookup warnings generated by the implicit cross-references created by the `:type:` and `:rtype:` fields in documentation.

It handles inputs in the form of gamma matrix products, where some of the matrices are contracted.

2. **Specifics of the Bug**: The bug appears when there are leading gamma matrices without contractions. When these matrices are simplified, they incorrectly reverse the order of the leading uncontracted gamma matrices.

3. **Expected vs. Actual Behavior**: The expected behavior is that expressions like $\gamma^\mu \gamma_\mu \gamma^\rho \gamma^\sigma$ and $\gamma^\rho \gamma^\sigma \gamma^\mu \gamma_\mu$ both simplify to $4\gamma^\rho \gamma^\sigma$. The actual behavior is that the order of $\gamma^\rho$ and $\gamma^\sigma$ is flipped in the second case.

4. **Relevant Code Sections**: I identified that the issue occurs because the leading gamma matrices are removed and then inserted in reverse order at the end of the function. The loop responsible for this insertion is backward.
